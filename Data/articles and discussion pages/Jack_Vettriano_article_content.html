<p><b>Jack Vettriano</b> (born <b>Jack Hoggan</b>, 17 November 1951 – 1 March 2025) was a Scottish painter, known for his distinctive figurative style, often depicting scenes of romance, mystery, and nostalgia. Largely self-taught, Vettriano gained international recognition with his 1992 painting <i><a href="/wiki/The_Singing_Butler" title="The Singing Butler">The Singing Butler</a>,</i> which became one of the best-selling art prints in the UK.
</p><p>His works, characterized by cinematic composition and atmospheric lighting, frequently depict elegantly dressed figures in ambiguous or intimate settings. Despite achieving commercial success, Vettriano's work has been met with mixed critical reception, with some art critics dismissing it as overly sentimental or populist. Nevertheless, he has remained a highly popular artist, with his paintings commanding significant prices at auction.
</p><p>Vettriano exhibited in prestigious venues, including the Royal Academy of Arts in London, and was honoured for his contributions to the arts. His influence extends beyond painting, with his artwork featured in books, film, and popular culture.

<p><b>Jack Hoggan</b> was born on 17 November 1951 in the industrial seaside town of <a href="/wiki/Methil" title="Methil">Methil</a>, Fife, where he also grew up. He was raised in poverty; he lived with his mother, father and older brother in a spartan miner's house, sharing a bed with his brother and wearing hand-me-down clothes. From the age of 10, his father sent him out delivering papers and milk, cleaning windows and picking potatoes – any job that would earn money. His father took half his earnings.
</p><p>Hoggan left school at 15 and later became an apprentice <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mining_engineer" title="Mining engineer">mining engineer</a>. For a short time in the late 1960s, he had a summer job as a <a href="/wiki/Bingo_(British_version)" title="Bingo (British version)">bingo</a> caller at the Beachcomber Amusements on <a href="/wiki/Leven,_Fife" title="Leven, Fife">Leven</a> Promenade. He took up painting as a hobby in the 1970s, when a girlfriend bought him a set of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Watercolour" title="Watercolour">watercolours</a> for his 21st birthday. His earliest paintings, under his birth name Jack Hoggan, were copies or <a href="/wiki/Pastiche" title="Pastiche">pastiches</a> of <a href="/wiki/Impressionism" title="Impressionism">impressionist</a> paintings; his first painting was a copy of <a href="/wiki/Claude_Monet" title="Claude Monet">Claude Monet</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Poppy_Field_near_Argenteuil" title="The Poppy Field near Argenteuil">The Poppy Field near Argenteuil</a></i>. Much of his influence came from studying paintings at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kirkcaldy_Museum_and_Art_Gallery" title="Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery">Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery</a>. In 1984, Hoggan first submitted his work to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Royal_Dutch_Shell" title="Royal Dutch Shell">Shell</a>-sponsored art exhibition in the museum.
</p><p>In 1987, when he was 36, Hoggan left his wife Gail, seeking to emulate <a href="/wiki/Paul_Gauguin" title="Paul Gauguin">Paul Gauguin</a>. He quit his job in <a href="/wiki/Educational_research" title="Educational research">educational research</a> and moved to <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> where he adopted his mother's maiden name <b>Vettriano</b>. He applied to study <a href="/wiki/Fine_art" title="Fine art">Fine Art</a> at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh" title="University of Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a>, but his portfolio was rejected.
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Career">Career</h2></div>
<p>In 1988, Vettriano submitted two canvases for the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Scottish_Academy" title="Royal Scottish Academy">Royal Scottish Academy</a> annual show. Both paintings sold on the first day and Vettriano was approached by several galleries. Further exhibitions followed in Edinburgh, <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> and <a href="/wiki/Johannesburg" title="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>. In November 1999, Vettriano's work was shown for the first time in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, when 21 paintings were displayed at The International 20th Century Arts Fair at <a href="/wiki/69th_Regiment_Armory" title="69th Regiment Armory">The Armory</a>. More than 40 collectors from the UK flew out for the event and 20 paintings were sold on the opening night.
</p><p>In 1996 <a href="/wiki/Terence_Conran" title="Terence Conran">Terence Conran</a> commissioned Vettriano to create a series of paintings for his new <a href="/wiki/Bluebird_Garage" title="Bluebird Garage">Bluebird Gastrodome</a> in London. The seven paintings, inspired by the life of <a href="/wiki/Malcolm_Campbell" title="Malcolm Campbell">Malcolm Campbell</a>, hung there for 10 years. Heartbreak Publishing, Vettriano's own publishing company, produced a boxed set featuring signed, limited-edition prints of all seven paintings to mark the 75th anniversary of Campbell's final <a href="/wiki/Land_speed_record" title="Land speed record">World Land Speed Record</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Bluebird_K7" title="Bluebird K7">Bluebird</a> paintings were auctioned by <a href="/wiki/Sotheby%27s" title="Sotheby's">Sotheby's</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Gleneagles_Hotel" title="Gleneagles Hotel">Gleneagles Hotel</a> in <a href="/wiki/Perthshire" title="Perthshire">Perthshire</a> on 30 August 2007 and made more than £1 million in all: the most expensive was <i>Bluebird at Bonneville</i>, bought for £468,000.
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Prices_and_values">Prices and values</h3></div>
<p>His easel paintings cost between £48,000 and £195,000 new. According to <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> he earned £500,000 a year in print royalties. Vettriano's 1992 painting, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Singing_Butler" title="The Singing Butler">The Singing Butler</a></i>, has been the best-selling image in Britain. On 21 April 2004, the original canvas of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Singing_Butler" title="The Singing Butler">The Singing Butler</a></i> sold at auction for £744,500. It had been rejected in 1992 by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Royal_Academy_summer_exhibition" title="Royal Academy summer exhibition">Royal Academy summer exhibition</a>. The composition for the painting, as discovered by Scottish designer Sandy Robb, had been sourced from the <i>Illustrator's Figure Reference Manual</i>.
</p><p>In April 2010, seven out of ten paintings by Vettriano failed to sell at Sotheby's spring auction of Scottish pictures. Those that sold did so for half their previous prices. Art experts suggested that the monetary value of Vettriano's works needed reassessing.
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Studios_and_publishing">Studios and publishing</h2></div>
<p>Vettriano had studios in Scotland and London. He was represented by the <a href="/wiki/Portland_Gallery" title="Portland Gallery">Portland Gallery</a>, London, from 1993 to 2007, and counted <a href="/wiki/Jack_Nicholson" title="Jack Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alex_Ferguson" title="Alex Ferguson">Alex Ferguson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tim_Rice" title="Tim Rice">Tim Rice</a> and <a href="/wiki/Robbie_Coltrane" title="Robbie Coltrane">Robbie Coltrane</a> amongst his collectors. To date, five books have been published about Vettriano, the most recent of which, <i>Studio Life</i>, was published in March 2008. In February 2009, Vettriano launched Heartbreak Publishing and his own London gallery, also called Heartbreak, which exclusively represents him, and also promotes younger artists.
</p><p>In March 2010, <i>Days of Wine And Roses</i> was opened by Scottish First Minister <a href="/wiki/Alex_Salmond" title="Alex Salmond">Alex Salmond</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Kirkcaldy" title="Kirkcaldy">Kirkcaldy</a> Museum. The exhibition then transferred to Vettriano's gallery in London.
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Personal_life">Personal life</h2></div>
<p>Divorced from his first wife, Vettriano divided his time between homes in London, <a href="/wiki/Kirkcaldy" title="Kirkcaldy">Kirkcaldy</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Nice" title="Nice">Nice</a>, France. In Kirkcaldy he lived in the boardroom section of the former Nairn linoleum factory, now converted into residential use.
</p><p>In November 2004, he was appointed an <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="Order of the British Empire">OBE</a>. He claimed he had drawn inspiration for his paintings from "25 years of sexual misbehaviour". In 2010, he told <i><a href="/wiki/The_Independent" title="The Independent">The Independent</a></i>: "I live in a world of heartbreak<span class="nowrap"> </span>... I just seem to be more creative when I'm in some kind of emotional distress", adding "It's been four years of soul-searching – <a href="/wiki/Nicotine" title="Nicotine">nicotine</a>, alcohol, anti-depressants, <a href="/wiki/Temazepam" title="Temazepam">temazepam</a>".
</p><p>In 2010, Vettriano said about relationships, "Whenever someone stays for longer than two days, I get cabin fever" and that he loves shoe-shopping with women.
</p><p>He liked to gamble on horses, but only bet what he could afford to lose. He set up the Vettriano Trust, and planned to leave his money to it to do good work.
</p><p>In February 2012, Vettriano was convicted at <a href="/wiki/Kirkcaldy_Sheriff_Court" title="Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court">Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court</a> of drunk-driving and possession of <a href="/wiki/Amphetamine" title="Amphetamine">amphetamine</a>. He was banned from driving for 18 months and fined £800. When stopped he told the police officer "You know who I am. We can sort this out."
</p><p>In 2022, he announced that he had two significantly younger East European muses who had helped him overcome <a href="/wiki/Cocaine" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a> and alcohol addiction and inspired him to paint again. One works as a waitress in an Edinburgh bistro, and he met the other at a sale in Nice. He explained to <i><a href="/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph" title="The Daily Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a></i>:
</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote"><p>I can't go on dating sites. I can't go clubbing. I can hardly bloody walk, never mind dance. So the opportunities to meet the opposite sex are really dwindling. But it goes a long way to say "oh, and by the way, look at my website". They see it's not just Joe Ordinary, which almost definitely helps.</p></blockquote>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Death">Death</h3></div>
<p>On 1 March 2025, Vettriano was found dead at his apartment in <a href="/wiki/Nice" title="Nice">Nice</a>, France. He was 73. His death was announced by his publicist two days later, on 3 March. Whilst the exact cause is unconfirmed, local media reported that there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death.

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Commissions">Commissions</h2></div>
<p>In January 2012, menswear brand <a href="/wiki/Stefano_Ricci" title="Stefano Ricci">Stefano Ricci</a> launched its Spring Summer 2012 collection with a campaign inspired by the work of Jack Vettriano. The SS 2012 catalogue, entitled <i>Stefano Ricci – a tribute to Vettriano</i>, featured images by Vettriano and photographic re-interpretations shot by <a href="/wiki/Fredi_Marcarini" title="Fredi Marcarini">Fredi Marcarini</a> featuring clothes and accessories from the Ricci 2012 collection. A short film about the 2012 Vettriano campaign commemorated the collaboration.
</p><p>In 2017, he was one of three artists commissioned to paint portraits of Scottish comedian <a href="/wiki/Billy_Connolly" title="Billy Connolly">Billy Connolly</a> to celebrate Connolly's 75th birthday. These were then put on display in Glasgow's People's Gallery, while the images were transferred to murals in the centre of <a href="/wiki/Glasgow" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>. Vettriano's mural is located in Dixon Street, off <a href="/wiki/St_Enoch_Square" title="St Enoch Square">St Enoch Square</a>. It was the subject of a <a href="/wiki/BBC_Scotland_(TV_channel)" title="BBC Scotland (TV channel)">BBC Scotland</a> documentary first broadcast on 14 June 2017.
</p><p>In 2018, Worthing's "Room with a View" gallery showcased 30 Vettriano paintings. Art dealer Jane Hill stated that Vettriano is  "self-taught which I admire immensely. He has really pulled himself up from the depth of nowhere."
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Artistic_style">Artistic style</h2></div>
<p>Vettriano was a self-taught artist in drawing and perspective, who manipulated paint in veiled glazes and meaningful shadows. Vettriano's style has been compared to those of <a href="/wiki/Edward_Hopper" title="Edward Hopper">Edward Hopper</a> and <a href="/wiki/Walter_Sickert" title="Walter Sickert">Walter Sickert</a>, and his scudded beaches to those of <a href="/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Boudin" title="Eugène Boudin">Eugène Boudin</a>. In many of his paintings, there is a hidden narrative, in enigmatic compositions, a starting point for dozens of short stories.
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Criticism">Criticism</h2></div>
<p>According to <i><a href="/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph" title="The Daily Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a></i> he has been described as the <a href="/wiki/Jeffrey_Archer" title="Jeffrey Archer">Jeffrey Archer</a> of the art world, a purveyor of "badly conceived soft porn", and a painter of "dim erotica". According to <i><a href="/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)" title="Vanity Fair (magazine)">Vanity Fair</a></i>, critics say Jack Vettriano paints brainless erotica. Sandy Moffat, head of drawing and painting at <a href="/wiki/Glasgow_School_of_Art" title="Glasgow School of Art">Glasgow School of Art</a>, said: "He can't paint, he just colours in." <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a>'</i>s art critic, <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Jones_(journalist)" title="Jonathan Jones (journalist)">Jonathan Jones</a>, described Vettriano's paintings as a group as "brainless" and said Vettriano "is not even an artist." <a href="/wiki/Richard_Calvocoressi" title="Richard Calvocoressi">Richard Calvocoressi</a>, at the time director of the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art" title="Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art">Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art</a>, said: "I'd be more than happy to say that we think him an indifferent painter and that he is very low down our list of priorities (whether or not we can afford his work, which at the moment we obviously can't). His 'popularity' rests on cheap commercial reproductions of his paintings."
</p><p>In 2013 in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i>, art critic <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Jones_(journalist)" title="Jonathan Jones (journalist)">Jonathan Jones</a> wrote: "Vettriano fixes on fetishistic, stylish objects and paints them with a slick, empty panache" and "The world of Jack Vettriano is a crass male fantasy that might have come straight out of <i>Money</i> by <a href="/wiki/Martin_Amis" title="Martin Amis">Martin Amis</a>".
</p><p>In <i><a href="/wiki/The_Scotsman" title="The Scotsman">The Scotsman</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/George_Kerevan" title="George Kerevan">George Kerevan</a> wrote "He suffers all the same criticisms of the early French Impressionists: mere <a href="/wiki/Wallpaper" title="Wallpaper">wallpaper</a>, too simplistic in execution and subject, too obviously erotic." Alice Jones wrote in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Independent" title="The Independent">The Independent</a></i>  that Vettriano has been labelled a chauvinist whose "women are sexual objects, frequently half naked and vulnerable, always in stockings and stilettos." Regarding the criticism, sculptor <a href="/wiki/David_Mach" title="David Mach">David Mach</a> has said: "If he was a fashion designer Jack would be right up there. It's all just art world snobbery. Anyway, who cares, he probably makes more money than <a href="/wiki/Damien_Hirst" title="Damien Hirst">Damien Hirst</a> anyway."
</p><p>In October 2005, after the original of <i>The Singing Butler</i> sold for £740,000, it came to light that Vettriano had used the artists' reference manual <i>The Illustrator's Figure Reference Manual</i> to form his figures, using Irish actress <a href="/wiki/Orla_Brady" title="Orla Brady">Orla Brady</a> for the 'lady in red.' In 2025, a <a href="/wiki/Banksy" title="Banksy">Banksy</a> interpretation of the work sold for £4.3m several days after Vettriano's death. The work, titled <i>Crude Oil (Vettriano)</i>, which was previously owned by <a href="/wiki/Blink-182" title="Blink-182">Blink 182</a> bassist <a href="/wiki/Mark_Hoppus" title="Mark Hoppus">Mark Hoppus</a>, was sold by Sotheby's in London to a private collector.

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Collaborations">Collaborations</h2></div>
<p>Alongside fellow <a href="/wiki/Fife" title="Fife">Fifer</a>, author <a href="/wiki/Ian_Rankin" title="Ian Rankin">Ian Rankin</a>, Vettriano put in a cameo appearance in a video with Scottish indie band Saint Jude's Infirmary made for <a href="/wiki/BBC_Scotland" title="BBC Scotland">BBC Scotland</a>'s <i>The Music Show</i>. The video was filmed on <a href="/wiki/Portobello,_Edinburgh" title="Portobello, Edinburgh">Portobello</a> Beach in Edinburgh and included visual references to two of Vettriano's most famous paintings, <i>Elegy for a Dead Admiral</i> and <i>The Singing Butler</i>. The lyrics of the track <i>Goodbye Jack Vettriano</i> were written by band member Grant Campbell after seeing a Vettriano print on a pub wall in <a href="/wiki/Rotterdam" title="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a>. Vettriano became a fan of the band after hearing their first album, <i>Happy Healthy Lucky Month</i>, and was inspired to create a painting which featured as the cover of the band's second album, for which both Vettriano and Rankin contributed spoken word pieces.
</p><p>In May 2008, Vettriano collaborated with Jackie Stewart, on a triptych of paintings entitled <i>Tension, Timing, Triumph – Monaco 1971</i>.
