<p>The <b>2025 Singaporean general election</b> was held on 3 May 2025 to elect all 97 <a href="/wiki/Member_of_parliament" title="Member of parliament">members</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore" title="Parliament of Singapore">Parliament of Singapore</a> across <a href="/wiki/Constituencies_of_Singapore" title="Constituencies of Singapore">33 constituencies</a>. It was the 19th general election in Singapore's history since <a href="/wiki/1948_Singaporean_general_election" title="1948 Singaporean general election">1948</a> and the first election under prime minister <a href="/wiki/Lawrence_Wong" title="Lawrence Wong">Lawrence Wong</a>, who succeeded <a href="/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong" title="Lee Hsien Loong">Lee Hsien Loong</a> in May 2024 and as secretary-general of the <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party" title="People's Action Party">People's Action Party</a> (PAP) that December. News outlets had described this election as "the first real test" of <a href="/wiki/Singaporeans" title="Singaporeans">Singaporeans</a>' confidence in Wong.
</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/14th_Parliament_of_Singapore" title="14th Parliament of Singapore">14th Parliament</a> was dissolved on 15 April, with Nomination Day held on 23 April. A record 211 candidates contested the election, including 53 women, the highest number of female candidates in Singapore's history. PAP won <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Marine_Parade%E2%80%93Braddell_Heights_GRC" title="Marine Parade–Braddell Heights GRC">Marine Parade–Braddell Heights GRC</a> uncontested – the first walkover since 2011. However, the elections also saw five multi-cornered fights in <a href="/wiki/Ang_Mo_Kio_Group_Representation_Constituency" title="Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency">Ang Mo Kio GRC</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sembawang_Group_Representation_Constituency" title="Sembawang Group Representation Constituency">Sembawang GRC</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tampines_Group_Representation_Constituency" title="Tampines Group Representation Constituency">Tampines GRC</a>, <a href="/wiki/Potong_Pasir_Single_Member_Constituency" title="Potong Pasir Single Member Constituency">Potong Pasir SMC</a> and <a href="/wiki/Radin_Mas_Single_Member_Constituency" title="Radin Mas Single Member Constituency">Radin Mas SMC</a>.
</p><p>The parties focused their campaigns on the <a href="/wiki/Cost_of_living" title="Cost of living">cost of living</a>, with opposition parties pushing for reductions or exemptions in the <a href="/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_(Singapore)" title="Goods and Services Tax (Singapore)">Goods and Services Tax</a> (GST). The opposition also called for reforms to <a href="/wiki/Public_housing_in_Singapore" title="Public housing in Singapore">public housing</a> policies. Additionally, parties such as the <a href="/wiki/Progress_Singapore_Party" title="Progress Singapore Party">Progress Singapore Party</a> (PSP) and the <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Alliance_for_Reform" title="People's Alliance for Reform">People's Alliance for Reform</a> (PAR) advocated for stricter <a href="/wiki/Immigration_to_Singapore" title="Immigration to Singapore">immigration controls</a>. The PAP focused its campaign on constituency-level achievements and emphasised policy discussions, marking a stark contrast to previous elections where personal attacks and national-level rhetoric had played a more prominent role. The elections also saw attempted <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Foreign_interference" title="Foreign interference">foreign interference</a>, especially by politicians from the <a href="/wiki/Malaysian_Islamic_Party" title="Malaysian Islamic Party">Malaysian Islamic Party</a> (PAS). On the last day of campaigning, the opposition also called for voters to "vote without fear".
</p><p>The PAP retained its <a href="/wiki/Supermajority" title="Supermajority">supermajority</a>, winning 87 out of 97 seats and improving its popular vote share to 65.57%. Analysts hailed the vote as a "strong mandate" for Wong's leadership team. The <a href="/wiki/Workers%27_Party" title="Workers' Party">Workers' Party</a> (WP) held all 10 of its seats and secured two <a href="/wiki/Non-constituency_Member_of_Parliament" title="Non-constituency Member of Parliament">Non-constituency Member of Parliament</a> (NCMP) seats, which some analysts viewed as reaffirming its position as the strongest challenger to the PAP’s longstanding dominance. The PSP, however, lost its two NCMP seats. A total of 27 candidates forfeited their election deposits as their vote shares were below 12.5%. Voter turnout was 92.47% – the lowest since <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/1968_Singapore_general_election" title="1968 Singapore general election">1968</a>. Wong later formed his <a href="/wiki/Second_Lawrence_Wong_Cabinet" title="Second Lawrence Wong Cabinet">cabinet</a> on 21 May.

<p>Under Singapore's constitution, the opposition will be guaranteed a set number of parliamentary seats which may consist of elected members of parliament (MP) from the opposition team and unsuccessful candidates in this election from the best-performing losing opposition party or parties, collectively known as <a href="/wiki/Non-constituency_Member_of_Parliament" title="Non-constituency Member of Parliament">Non-constituency Members of Parliament</a> (NCMP).

<p>On 8 March 2024, the Elections Department (ELD) announced that 50,000 public servants had been appointed as election officials. After Lawrence Wong became prime minister in May 2024, the <i><a href="/wiki/South_China_Morning_Post" title="South China Morning Post">South China Morning Post</a></i> speculated that elections could be held as early as September; elections were typically held around the school breaks of March and September. <a href="/wiki/Goh_Chok_Tong" title="Goh Chok Tong">Goh Chok Tong</a> held his <a href="/wiki/1991_Singaporean_general_election" title="1991 Singaporean general election">first general election in August 1991</a>, ten months after he assumed office in November 1990; his successor <a href="/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong" title="Lee Hsien Loong">Lee Hsien Loong</a> held his <a href="/wiki/2006_Singaporean_general_election" title="2006 Singaporean general election">first general election in May 2006</a>, two years after he assumed office in August 2004. However, Eugene Tan, an associate professor at <a href="/wiki/Singapore_Management_University" title="Singapore Management University">Singapore Management University</a>, felt a September election would be "hasty" for Wong to establish his mandate, and that the election was more likely to be held after the announcement of the 2025 budget. Holding the elections in 2025 would coincide with the country's SG60 <a href="/wiki/National_Day_(Singapore)" title="National Day (Singapore)">National Day</a> celebrations.
</p><p>Following Lee Hsien Loong's announcement in April 2024 that he would step down as prime minister in May, <i><a href="/wiki/CNA_(TV_network)" title="CNA (TV network)">Channel NewsAsia</a></i> (<i>CNA</i>) speculated that the general elections could be held at the end of that year. However, Lee's successor, Lawrence Wong, said in November that the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) had not yet been convened. Following the formation of the EBRC in January 2025, political observers interviewed by <i>The Straits Times</i> speculated that the election could be held as early as April or May, following the passage of the 2025 budget. July was deemed unlikely because it would be right before the <a href="/wiki/National_Day_(Singapore)" title="National Day (Singapore)">SG60 National Day celebrations</a>.

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Voter_rolls">Voter rolls</h3></div>
<p>The ELD released a statement outlining that the Register of Electors would be refreshed in 2025, being closed for updating a few months ahead of the plausible election date. As such, for the 2025 election, a citizen must be aged 21 and above as of 1 February 2025 to be able to vote.

The voter rolls opened for public inspection from 15 to 28 February, and was updated on 24 March, further increasing the electorate to 2,758,095; after the writ of election is issued, the number was further increased to 2,758,858. By 18 April 2025, 18,389 voters were registered as overseas voters, with 8,630 casting their votes at one of 10 overseas polling stations, and 9,759 via <a href="/wiki/Postal_voting" title="Postal voting">postal voting</a>, first introduced in the <a href="/wiki/2023_Singaporean_presidential_election" title="2023 Singaporean presidential election">2023 Singaporean presidential election</a>.

On 31 May 2024, the ELD announced that the Returning Officer, appointed by the prime minister to ensure fair and orderly elections, would have the authority to instruct individuals and social media platforms to remove online election advertisements that violate election regulations.

The EBRC released their report on 11 March, which called for the creation of 18 GRCs and 15 SMCs. The number of MPs in the next parliament was increased to 97 elected seats. These changes were to account for the uneven distribution of growth in the number of electors across the existing electoral divisions, with most notable changes in the <a href="/wiki/East_Region,_Singapore" title="East Region, Singapore">eastern</a> and <a href="/wiki/West_Region,_Singapore" title="West Region, Singapore">western</a> ends of Singapore.
</p><p>The report introduced six new SMCs: <a href="/wiki/Jurong_Central_Single_Member_Constituency" title="Jurong Central Single Member Constituency">Jurong Central</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sembawang_West_Single_Member_Constituency" title="Sembawang West Single Member Constituency">Sembawang West</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bukit_Gombak_Single_Member_Constituency" title="Bukit Gombak Single Member Constituency">Bukit Gombak</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jalan_Kayu_Single_Member_Constituency" title="Jalan Kayu Single Member Constituency">Jalan Kayu</a>, <a href="/wiki/Queenstown_Single_Member_Constituency" title="Queenstown Single Member Constituency">Queenstown</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Tampines_Changkat_Single_Member_Constituency" title="Tampines Changkat Single Member Constituency">Tampines Changkat</a>. In turn, five current SMCs – <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bukit_Batok_SMC" title="Bukit Batok SMC">Bukit Batok</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hong_Kah_North_SMC" title="Hong Kah North SMC">Hong Kah North</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MacPherson_SMC" title="MacPherson SMC">MacPherson</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Punggol_West_SMC" title="Punggol West SMC">Punggol West</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Yuhua_SMC" title="Yuhua SMC">Yuhua</a> – were absorbed into neighbouring GRCs. The boundaries of only four existing SMCs, namely <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bukit_Panjang_SMC" title="Bukit Panjang SMC">Bukit Panjang</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hougang_SMC" title="Hougang SMC">Hougang</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Marymount_SMC" title="Marymount SMC">Marymount</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pioneer_SMC" title="Pioneer SMC">Pioneer</a>, remained unchanged.
</p><p>Many GRCs in the east and west of Singapore were reorganised. Jurong GRC was split into the newly-established <a href="/wiki/Jurong_East%E2%80%93Bukit_Batok_Group_Representation_Constituency" title="Jurong East–Bukit Batok Group Representation Constituency">Jurong East–Bukit Batok</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/West_Coast-Jurong_West_Group_Representation_Constituency" title="West Coast-Jurong West Group Representation Constituency">West Coast–Jurong West GRCs</a>. West Coast GRC was renamed to West Coast–Jurong West GRC. In the east, Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC was split into <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pasir_Ris-Changi_Group_Representation_Constituency" title="Pasir Ris-Changi Group Representation Constituency">Pasir Ris–Changi</a> and <a href="/wiki/Punggol_Group_Representation_Constituency" title="Punggol Group Representation Constituency">Punggol GRCs</a>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Marine_Parade_GRC" title="Marine Parade GRC">Marine Parade GRC</a> was also renamed into <a href="/wiki/Marine_Parade%E2%80%93Braddell_Heights_Group_Representation_Constituency" title="Marine Parade–Braddell Heights Group Representation Constituency">Marine Parade–Braddell Heights GRC</a> as it absorbed <a href="/wiki/MacPherson,_Singapore" title="MacPherson, Singapore">MacPherson</a>, and parts of <a href="/wiki/Potong_Pasir" title="Potong Pasir">Potong Pasir</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mountbatten,_Singapore" title="Mountbatten, Singapore">Mountbatten</a>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bishan-Toa_Payoh_GRC" title="Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC">Bishan–Toa Payoh</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jalan_Besar_GRC" title="Jalan Besar GRC">Jalan Besar</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Marsiling-Yew_Tee_GRC" title="Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC">Marsiling–Yew Tee</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nee_Soon_GRC" title="Nee Soon GRC">Nee Soon</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sengkang_GRC" title="Sengkang GRC">Sengkang GRCs</a> remained unchanged.
</p><p>The boundary changes were accepted by the Singapore government. While the <a href="/wiki/Progress_Singapore_Party" title="Progress Singapore Party">Progress Singapore Party</a> (PSP) was "heartened that the EBRC has somewhat disclosed more of the reasoning behind its decisions, contrary to its previous report in 2020", the party felt that "the EBRC could have accounted for population shifts without making drastic changes to existing major electoral boundaries". The <a href="/wiki/Singapore_Democratic_Party" title="Singapore Democratic Party">Singapore Democratic Party</a> (SDP) expressed "disappointment with the disappearance of Yuhua and Bukit Batok SMCs" – the electoral districts where the SDP had planned to contest – and claimed the process of redrawing boundaries "lacked transparency". Similarly, on 25 March, <a href="/wiki/Workers%27_Party_(Singapore)" title="Workers' Party (Singapore)">Workers' Party</a>'s (WP) <a href="/wiki/Pritam_Singh" title="Pritam Singh">Pritam Singh</a> cited the change as "one of the most radical redrawing(s)" in one of his Facebook posts, and said that an opaque institution could become divisive and that changes to the political system could be greatly improved.

<p>In November 2018, the governing <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party" title="People's Action Party">People's Action Party</a> (PAP) appointed <a href="/wiki/Heng_Swee_Keat" title="Heng Swee Keat">Heng Swee Keat</a> as the party's first assistant secretary-general. <i><a href="/wiki/The_Straits_Times" title="The Straits Times">The Straits Times</a></i> speculated that with Heng's appointment, he would succeed <a href="/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong" title="Lee Hsien Loong">Lee Hsien Loong</a> as the next prime minister. Heng remained in the PAP's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Central_Executive_Committee_(PAP)" title="Central Executive Committee (PAP)">Central Executive Committee</a> (CEC) in the 2020 party elections, in which <a href="/wiki/Lawrence_Wong" title="Lawrence Wong">Lawrence Wong</a> was first elected into the CEC. However, in April 2021, Heng stepped down as leader of the PAP's fourth-generation (4G) team, citing his age and health concerns. Analysts from <i>The Straits Times</i> suggested that Heng's withdrawal might be due to the PAP's weaker performance in the previous general election, where it secured only 61.24% of the popular vote. This outcome could signal a lack of voter confidence in his leadership. On the other hand, <i>CNA</i> analysts said Heng still held support from the 4G team following the elections and suggested Heng's decision might be "personal".
</p><p>In a party caucus on 14 April 2022, finance minister Wong was selected as the leader of the 4G team, following consultations with other ministers of the 4G team. On 13 June that year, Wong was appointed deputy prime minister (DPM) following a cabinet reshuffle. Wong also assumed responsibility for the Strategy Group within the <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister%27s_Office_(Singapore)" title="Prime Minister's Office (Singapore)">Prime Minister's Office</a>. On 5 November 2023, Lee said he would hand over party leadership to Wong in 2024, before the party's 70th anniversary. On 15 April 2024, Lee announced Wong would succeed him as prime minister on 15 May. In Wong's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lawrence_Wong_Cabinet" title="Lawrence Wong Cabinet">new cabinet</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gan_Kim_Yong" title="Gan Kim Yong">Gan Kim Yong</a> was promoted as DPM and Lee was appointed as senior minister; Wong only planned major changes to the cabinet after the next election. On 24 November, at the PAP's biennial conference celebrating the party's 70th anniversary, Lee stepped down as secretary-general, although he remained in the CEC. Gan also stepped down from the CEC, while <a href="/wiki/Chee_Hong_Tat" title="Chee Hong Tat">Chee Hong Tat</a> was co-opted into CEC for the first time. On 4 December 2024, Wong was elected as the PAP secretary-general.
</p><p>At the party's Women's Wing conference on 1 September 2024, Wong pledged to field <a href="/wiki/Women_in_Singaporean_politics" title="Women in Singaporean politics">more women candidates</a> in the upcoming election. Candidates were to be progressively announced before the expiry of the parliament term, including the successors for the three (out of four) vacated seats, three new members in the opposition-held constituencies, and at least one candidate in a potential <a href="/wiki/Marginal_seat" title="Marginal seat">swing constituency</a>. On 7 July 2023, <a href="/wiki/Tharman_Shanmugaratnam" title="Tharman Shanmugaratnam">Tharman Shanmugaratnam</a> resigned from all his positions in the government and as a member of the PAP to run for the <a href="/wiki/2023_Singaporean_presidential_election" title="2023 Singaporean presidential election">2023 presidential election</a>. He won the election and was elected president on 14 September.

On 2 August 2023, <a href="/wiki/Seah_Kian_Peng" title="Seah Kian Peng">Seah Kian Peng</a> succeeded Tan as speaker of parliament.
</p><p>The CPIB concluded its investigations into Iswaran on 9 January 2024, and the case was handed over to the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) for prosecution. A week later, Iswaran resigned as transport minister and from the PAP. He also pledged to repay the government the salary he received since the CPIB investigation began in July 2023. On 18 January, Iswaran was charged in the <a href="/wiki/State_Courts_of_Singapore" title="State Courts of Singapore">state courts</a> with 27 offences, including charges of corruption and obstruction of justice, He was the first cabinet minister to face corruption charges after national development minister <a href="/wiki/Teh_Cheang_Wan" title="Teh Cheang Wan">Teh Cheang Wan</a> in 1986.

On 7 December 2024, Low confirmed he would not contest in the 2025 elections. On 18 November, the WP hired external firms to assist with candidate screening and personality reviews to ensure better representation for Singapore in the upcoming election.

<p>The trial involving the WP leaders over alleged breaches of duties as town councillors for Aljunied–Hougang (AHTC) and Sengkang Town Councils (STC) concluded with a successful appeal in July 2024. While the <a href="/wiki/High_Court_of_Singapore" title="High Court of Singapore">High Court</a> initially found that WP MPs, councillors, and FMSS owners had breached their duties, the court of appeal overturned these rulings. As a result, the WP was awarded the costs, and the town councils’ claims for damages and legal costs were dismissed. In the last review of the town councils on 27 June 2024, both the town councils of Aljunied–Hougang and Sengkang had outperformed better in its management areas over the years.
</p><p>On 30 November 2021, <a href="/wiki/Raeesah_Khan" title="Raeesah Khan">Raeesah Khan</a> admitted to making unsubstantiated allegations in Parliament on three occasions and subsequently resigned. Following the Parliament's Committee of Privileges' interview regarding Khan, party leaders Singh and <a href="/wiki/Faisal_Manap" title="Faisal Manap">Faisal Manap</a> were referred to the public prosecutor for potentially misleading parliament. Faisal has since been advised by the police "to familiarise himself with the conduct expected of MPs". On 20 March 2024, Singh was charged for lying to Parliament by the public prosecutor. The trial concluded on 8 November. On 17 February 2025, the court issued a maximum S$7,000 fine for both counts; Singh has since lodged an appeal. However, he was not barred from elections as the sentences are counted separately.

Both members subsequently resigned from the party.

<p>After the 2020 general election, assistant secretary-general <a href="/wiki/Leong_Mun_Wai" title="Leong Mun Wai">Leong Mun Wai</a> and vice-chairwoman <a href="/wiki/Hazel_Poa" title="Hazel Poa">Hazel Poa</a> stepped down from their leadership positions as they were appointed NCMPs by prime minister Lee Hsien Loong. As part of the party's reorganisation, a policy research team was formed to support its NCMPs, alongside new youth and women's wings. Amidst reports of internal party rifts and calls for a leadership refresh, PSP founder <a href="/wiki/Tan_Cheng_Bock" title="Tan Cheng Bock">Tan Cheng Bock</a> stepped down as secretary-general to become chairman on 3 April 2021, with <a href="/wiki/Francis_Yuen" title="Francis Yuen">Francis Yuen</a> succeeding him as secretary-general. However, Yuen stepped down from the role on 26 March 2023. Leong was elected as secretary-general on 4 April, which political analysts on <i>CNA</i> interpreted as a sign of the party's confidence in him and an endorsement of his parliamentary debate style. In May 2023, chairman Tan declared his readiness to contest the upcoming elections, while Leong announced the possibility of "proactively facilitating" an opposition alliance.
</p><p>On 23 February 2024, the PSP announced Leong's resignation from the post. Leong had accepted responsibility for a recent <a href="/wiki/Protection_from_Online_Falsehoods_and_Manipulation_Act_2019" title="Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019">Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act</a> (POFMA) order against his social media post concerning financial aid to an elderly couple in West Coast. He was succeeded by Poa. On 13 May, assistant secretary-general <a href="/wiki/Ang_Yong_Guan" title="Ang Yong Guan">Ang Yong Guan</a>, who was also a doctor of his own practice, was suspended from medical practice. He was found guilty of professional misconduct for his role in a patient's 2012 death due to improper medication prescriptions. The PSP said it respected the court's decision. On 5 February 2025, the PSP confirmed that Ang would not contest in the 2025 elections.
</p><p>In a walkabout at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/West_Coast_GRC" title="West Coast GRC">West Coast GRC</a> in January 2024, Tan Cheng Bock reaffirmed his plans to contest in the next elections. Tan anticipated a redrawing of West Coast GRC's electoral boundaries, describing the constituency as "too big".  In the next CEC election on 20 March 2025, Tan, Poa and Leong were re-elected into the CEC along with six new faces. The party also confirmed their intention to contest in <a href="/wiki/Chua_Chu_Kang_Group_Representation_Constituency" title="Chua Chu Kang Group Representation Constituency">Chua Chu Kang GRC</a> and <a href="/wiki/West_Coast%E2%80%93Jurong_West_Group_Representation_Constituency" title="West Coast–Jurong West Group Representation Constituency">West Coast–Jurong West GRC</a>, among other constituencies, but did not disclose who would stand in the election. On 26 March, Leong was reinstated as secretary-general. On 20 April, the PSP confirmed that Tan, Leong and Poa would contest in West Coast–Jurong West GRC. Political analyst Felix Tan believed the leadership change would not sway voters, citing existing trust in the party's core leadership and the likely insignificance of Leong's past POFMA incident. However, NUS associate professor Chong Ja Ian raised concerns about the frequency of leadership changes, suggesting it could undermine the party's perceived stability. However, he also posited that Leong's reinstatement might signal the party's preference for his more vocal leadership style over Poa's.

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading4"><h4 id="Volunteer_disruption">Volunteer disruption</h4></div>
<p>On 4 January, PSP and PAP volunteers were involved in altercations during their walkabouts in <a href="/wiki/Bukit_Gombak" title="Bukit Gombak">Bukit Gombak</a>. PSP treasurer Sri Nallakaruppan claimed that PAP volunteers  followed PSP volunteers who were distributing flyers. When asked to conduct their outreach elsewhere, the PAP volunteers asserted that the area was "their territory.". PAP cadre <a href="/wiki/Low_Yen_Ling" title="Low Yen Ling">Low Yen Ling</a> alleged however that PSP volunteers started the altercation, and PAP volunteer Azman Ibrahim released two videos documenting PSP's aggressive behaviour against him. Tan Cheng Bock stated he found no evidence of such behaviour, only subtitles in the videos alleging such. Tan later told on the media on 12 January that these members had to adhere the code of conduct, and confirmed that neither party's volunteers were physically harmed. Police investigations are ongoing.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Singapore_Democratic_Party" title="Singapore Democratic Party">Singapore Democratic Party</a> (SDP) began its walkabouts in August 2023, mainly in constituencies where it had contested in the previous election. SDP had also previously announced its intention to contest <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sembawang_GRC" title="Sembawang GRC">Sembawang GRC</a> for the first time since the <a href="/wiki/2011_Singaporean_general_election" title="2011 Singaporean general election">2011 election</a>. On 11 November 2023, the party relocated their headquarters to WGECA Tower, bringing it closer to constituencies where it had been active, including Bukit Batok, Bukit Panjang, Holland–Bukit Timah, Marsiling–Yew Tee, and Yuhua. On 20 February 2025, the SDP announced that secretary-general <a href="/wiki/Chee_Soon_Juan" title="Chee Soon Juan">Chee Soon Juan</a> would contest in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bukit_Batok_SMC" title="Bukit Batok SMC">Bukit Batok SMC</a> for the third time to "keep its primary focus on the constituencies" where the party maintains a presence. However, following the redistricting of Bukit Batok SMC into the new Jurong East–Bukit Batok GRC, Chee announced on 23 March 2025 that he would contest in the newly-created <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sembawang_West_SMC" title="Sembawang West SMC">Sembawang West SMC</a> instead, while chairman <a href="/wiki/Paul_Tambyah" title="Paul Tambyah">Paul Tambyah</a> would contest in <a href="/wiki/Bukit_Panjang_Single_Member_Constituency" title="Bukit Panjang Single Member Constituency">Bukit Panjang SMC</a>.
</p><p>The Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA), consisting of the <a href="/wiki/Singapore_Justice_Party" title="Singapore Justice Party">Singapore Justice Party</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Singapore_Malay_National_Organisation" title="Singapore Malay National Organisation">Singapore Malay National Organisation</a>, planned to contest in Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC as they did so since 2006. SDA chief <a href="/wiki/Desmond_Lim" title="Desmond Lim">Desmond Lim</a> also stated that the alliance is working to amend its constitution to allow associate members to join under the SDA banner, including independent candidates. Following the redrawing of electoral boundaries, the SDA announced its plans to contest in Pasir Ris–Changi GRC, and is open to discussions with WP regarding the boundary changes for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Punggol_GRC" title="Punggol GRC">Punggol GRC</a><b>.</b> Despite opposition parties outlining their intentions, NUS professor Chong viewed it as a strategic move to coordinate among themselves, given that none have the manpower to contest all seats. Meanwhile, Kasthuri Prameswaren, an associate faculty member at the <a href="/wiki/Singapore_University_of_Social_Sciences" title="Singapore University of Social Sciences">Singapore University of Social Sciences</a>, emphasized the importance of opposition parties forming blocs and following through with their plans rather than merely "paying lip service".
</p><p>In August 2020, <a href="/wiki/Reform_Party_(Singapore)" title="Reform Party (Singapore)">Reform Party</a> (RP) secretary general <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Jeyaretnam" title="Kenneth Jeyaretnam">Kenneth Jeyaretnam</a> removed chairman Andy Zhu and treasurer Noraini Yunus from the party's CEC. The party accused Zhu and Yunus of improper handling of the party's bank account, and the CEC unanimously agreed to their removal. Zhu claimed the allegations were "baseless" and criticised Jeyaretnam's "undemocratic stance". He was succeeded by <a href="/wiki/Charles_Yeo" title="Charles Yeo">Charles Yeo</a>. In January 2021, Zhu formed a splinter party, <a href="/wiki/Singapore_United_Party" title="Singapore United Party">Singapore United Party</a> (SUP), with several former members of RP. On 15 January 2022, Yeo resigned as chairman following police investigations against him for alleged criminal breach of trust and forgery. Yeo claimed the charges were "politically motivated", which the police denied. Yasmine Valentina became the acting RP chairman. Separately, Yeo was also charged under the Protection from Harassment Act for harassing a police officer and wounding the religious feelings of Christians. While Yeo posted bail in July 2022 and was allowed to leave Singapore for a hearing in Vietnam, he instead sought political asylum in the United Kingdom. Singapore sent an extradition request to the UK in October 2023, and Yeo was arrested by UK authorities on 4 November 2024.

<p>In June 2023, <a href="/wiki/Peoples_Voice_(Singapore)" title="Peoples Voice (Singapore)">Peoples Voice</a> (PV) chief <a href="/wiki/Lim_Tean" title="Lim Tean">Lim Tean</a> founded the <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Alliance_for_Reform" title="People's Alliance for Reform">People's Alliance for Reform</a> (PAR), uniting RP, the <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Power_Party_(Singapore)" title="People's Power Party (Singapore)">People's Power Party</a> (PPP), and the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Progressive_Party_(Singapore)" title="Democratic Progressive Party (Singapore)">Democratic Progressive Party</a> (DPP). This marks the first creation of a political alliance since the <a href="/wiki/Singapore_Democratic_Alliance" title="Singapore Democratic Alliance">Singapore Democratic Alliance</a> (SDA) during the 2001 election. The PAR aimed to contest in all the seats which the respective parties contested in the previous election. However, in February 2025, the PPP withdrew from PAR, citing "irreconcilable strategic differences". Lim said the PPP insisted on contesting in Tampines GRC, a move opposed by the other coalition members. The other parties also objected to PPP's position to halt COVID-19 vaccinations in the country. Despite the departure, PPP's secretary general <a href="/wiki/Goh_Meng_Seng" title="Goh Meng Seng">Goh Meng Seng</a> stated that the party is open to future collaboration with PAR. In the same month, the PAR announced its plans to contest in several constituencies, including Jalan Besar, Tanjong Pagar, Nee Soon, Potong Pasir, Mountbatten, Radin Mas, Yio Chu Kang, and Kebun Baru, with combined teams fielded for the GRCs.
</p><p>Lim Tean, who was convicted in July 2024 for practicing law without a valid certificate, was sentenced to six weeks in jail and fined S$1,000 (US$745) on 17 February. Like Singh, Lim is still eligible for elections and intends to appeal his conviction and sentence. Following the redrawing of electoral boundaries, Lim declared that the PAR was ready to contest in 10 constituencies.
</p><p>In October 2023, the <a href="/wiki/Singapore_People%27s_Party" title="Singapore People's Party">Singapore People's Party</a> (SPP), <a href="/wiki/National_Solidarity_Party_(Singapore)" title="National Solidarity Party (Singapore)">National Solidarity Party</a> (NSP), <a href="/wiki/Red_Dot_United" title="Red Dot United">Red Dot United</a> (RDU), and <a href="/wiki/Singapore_United_Party" title="Singapore United Party">Singapore United Party</a> (SUP) announced a "non-formal partnership", named <a href="/wiki/The_Coalition_(Singapore)" title="The Coalition (Singapore)">the Coalition</a>. The partnership was aimed at preventing three-cornered contests, developing a joint manifesto, and exploring candidate-sharing arrangements during elections. While the Coalition has no dominant party or leader, RDU would serve as the secretariat for administrative matters. The parties of the Coalition aimed to contest in Tampines, Sembawang, Ang Mo Kio, Yio Chu Kang, Kebun Baru, Bishan–Toa Payoh, Potong Pasir, Jurong, and Nee Soon. RDU volunteers also visited Tanjong Pagar, Yuhua, Kebun Bahru, and Radin Mas. Following the changes in electoral boundaries, RDU announced its plans to contest in Jurong East–Bukit Batok, Nee Soon, and Tanjong Pagar GRCs, and the SMCs of Jurong Central, Jalan Kayu, and Radin Mas. NSP announced its plans to contest in Sembawang West and Tampines Changkat, and in the GRCs of Jalan Besar, Marine Parade–Braddell Heights, Marsiling–Yew Tee, Sembawang and Tampines. On 12 April, RDU announced their departure from the Coalition, citing concerns about other member parties' involvement in multi-cornered contests.

<p>Nomination Day was held on 23 April, and nomination centres opened from 11:00 to 12:00 for candidates to file their nomination papers, a political donation certificate, and in the case of GRCs, at least one minority candidate and a certificate confirming their minority status. The <a href="/wiki/Election_deposit" title="Election deposit">election deposit</a> for the election is <a href="/wiki/Singapore_dollar" title="Singapore dollar">S$</a>13,500 per candidate (rounded down from MP's allowance of S$13,750; same amount as of the previous general election). As with previous elections, candidates or teams failing to secure 12.5% of the valid votes cast would result in their forfeiture of deposit.
</p><p>Ten nomination centres were set up for nomination day. A total of 211 candidates contested in the election, including 89 first-time candidates, 32 of whom were from the ruling PAP. Twenty incumbent MPs, all from PAP, did not seek election. The election also saw the highest number of female candidates at 53.

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Political_issues">Political issues</h3></div>
<p>A January 2025 study by Blackbox Research's sentiment tracker, SensingSG, found that the cost of living remained the primary concern for Singaporeans. Voters also cited employment and housing as key issues, while higher-income groups expressed concerns about civil rights and democracy. Respondents indicated they prioritised the quality of governance at the constituency level rather than the national level, with nearly 90% of respondents expressing this view. Additionally, 88% of respondents emphasised the importance of candidate quality in their constituency, while 87.8% highlighted service delivery and infrastructure as key factors. Unlike in other countries, Blackbox anticipated that the upcoming general election would not be driven by personality-based politics.
</p><p>Bhavan Jaipragas of <i>The Straits Times</i> commented that beyond everyday concerns like public housing and living costs, opposition parties should also address geopolitical matters as these can significantly influence domestic issues, particularly with the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Tariffs_in_the_second_Trump_administration" title="Tariffs in the second Trump administration">tariffs by the second Trump administration</a>. <i><a href="/wiki/Agence_France-Presse" title="Agence France-Presse">Agence France-Presse</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Nikkei_Asia" title="Nikkei Asia">Nikkei Asia</a></i> expected that economic uncertainties due to the tariffs would be a key concern among voters. Jaipragas also called for voters not to take Singapore's relevance and sovereignty for granted as he cited a 2009 <a href="/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew" title="Lee Kuan Yew">Lee Kuan Yew</a> speech. On the other hand, commentators on <i>SCMP</i> expected voters to prioritise domestic issues over international affairs. Analysts on <i>CNA</i> said the PAP's traditional "flight to safety" strategy during times of crisis – appealing to voters' to stick with familiar leadership – may not be as effective amid growing voter scepticism and a more diverse electorate. Teo on <i>SCMP</i> added that the electorate might desire diverse voices in parliament. Opposition leaders have called for unity through parliamentary diversity, pushing back on what they see as government fearmongering. Analysts expect that building trust, demonstrating sincerity, and clearly communicating plans to address both global developments and domestic issues are essential in shaping electoral outcomes.
</p><p>Ahead of the upcoming election, <i>CNA</i> and other <a href="/wiki/Mediacorp" title="Mediacorp">Mediacorp</a> media outlets identified <a href="/wiki/East_Coast_Group_Representation_Constituency" title="East Coast Group Representation Constituency">East Coast</a>, <a href="/wiki/Marine_Parade_Group_Representation_Constituency" title="Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency">Marine Parade</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sengkang_Group_Representation_Constituency" title="Sengkang Group Representation Constituency">Sengkang</a>, and <a href="/wiki/West_Coast_Group_Representation_Constituency" title="West Coast Group Representation Constituency">West Coast</a> GRCs as potential election "hotspots", with residents across these districts primarily concerned about the rising cost of living, employment, job security, and housing affordability. In East Coast, where PAP narrowly beat WP in 2020, ageing infrastructure and elderly support are major issues. Private estate owners also seek greater transparency on lease renewals. In Marine Parade, in addition to concerns regarding immigration, job competition, school placements, <i>CNA</i> speculated that <a href="/wiki/Tan_Chuan-Jin" title="Tan Chuan-Jin">Tan Chuan-Jin</a>'s marital affair could influence the constituency's electoral outcome as he was well-regarded among residents there. In WP-held Sengkang, national issues take priority over constituency-level issues like estate cleanliness. Meanwhile, in West Coast, where the PAP won by just 3.36% in 2020, estate management and transport are key concerns. <i>CNA</i> believes the <a href="/wiki/Prosecution_of_S._Iswaran" title="Prosecution of S. Iswaran">prosecution of S. Iswaran</a> and the presence of PSP's founding chairman <a href="/wiki/Tan_Cheng_Bock" title="Tan Cheng Bock">Tan Cheng Bock</a>, a former PAP MP, could determine the next election outcome.
</p><p>In a <i>CNA</i> survey after the redrawing of electoral boundaries, most residents in redrawn constituencies like East Coast, Marine Parade–Braddell Heights, and West Coast–Jurong West were largely indifferent to the changes. However, residents in East Coast and Marine Parade–Braddell Heights had questioned the rationale, and political analysts noted the opposition could face more challenges. Analysts on <i>The Straits Times</i>, such as Mustafa Izzuddin and Felix Tan, believe that the boundary changes have strengthened support for the PAP in the newly formed GRCs in the west. Analysts also suggested that East Coast could be highly competitive due to the inclusion of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Joo_Chiat_SMC" title="Joo Chiat SMC">Joo Chiat's</a> educated, middle-class voters, who might prioritise political pluralism and checks on parliamentary power. Political observer Tan noted that younger voters in the newly formed Punggol GRC could potentially influence voting trends, and <i>The Straits Times</i> expected a fierce PAP–WP fight in Punggol. However, Teo believed that many voters would focus more on national issues, party performance, and candidate quality than constituency-specific changes.
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Social_media">Social media</h3></div>
<p>Before the election campaign, <i>The Straits Times</i> reported in 2024 that politicians and political parties were prioritising their social media presence, with Teo Kay Key predicting that social media would play a significant role in the upcoming general election campaign. According to Bhavan Jaipragas of <i>The Straits Times</i>, the political climate in Singapore remains "comparatively healthy", but noted increasing polarisation on social media.
</p><p>The PAP has engaged social media influencers, with its MPs having actively used social media for outreach. According to a March 2025 <i>CNA Today</i> article, the PAP stated that it avoids a "one-size-fits-all" approach to social media. The party noted that its MPs address a range of issues important to them and their residents, utilising social media in ways that best suit their personalities. The WP and other opposition parties have been regularly updating their accounts with walkabout reports and other activities, and believe social media is essential "for leveling the playing field" and directly engaging with Singaporeans. <a href="/wiki/Ravi_Philemon" title="Ravi Philemon">Ravi Philemon</a> of RDU said a social media presence is essential to compete against established parties with large followings. However, many had to operate with limited resources and depend on volunteers to manage their social media accounts.
</p><p>While social media engagement is seen as crucial for voter outreach, Teo believed that the electorate is unlikely to rely solely on social media in their voting choices. The WP views social media as a complement rather than a substitute for its longstanding commitment to on-the-ground engagement. On the other hand, SDP vice-chairman Bryan Lim stated that social media has been effective in addressing "some of the weaknesses of ground work," such as allowing him to connect with constituents he may not have the opportunity to engage with in depth.

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Podcasts">Podcasts</h3></div>
<link href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1273380762/mw-parser-output/.tmulti" rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style">
<p>Politicians, including prime minister Lawrence Wong, health minister <a href="/wiki/Ong_Ye_Kung" title="Ong Ye Kung">Ong Ye Kung</a>, and NCMP Hazel Poa, have appeared on local podcasts as part of their communication and campaign strategy. Producers and hosts of four Singaporean podcasts told <i>CNA Today</i> that political interest in appearing on their platforms has surged since 2020, especially ahead of this year's election. Experts interviewed by <i>The Straits Times</i> suggested that the casual format allows politicians to connect with voters beyond traditional media, particularly younger people and older millennials. Kenneth Paul Tan of <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong_Baptist_University" title="Hong Kong Baptist University">Hong Kong Baptist University</a> noted that podcasts in Singapore serve both as hegemonic reinforcement and contestation. While they help the PAP humanise its leaders and foster relatability, it also allows the opposition to bypass mainstream media, challenge the PAP, and appeal to disillusioned Singaporeans especially in Singapore's tightly controlled media landscape. Tan also believed that podcasts during the election changed Singaporeans' engagement with politics as politicians became more candid while voters "began listening differently".
</p><p>Natalie Pang, head of NUS's Department of Communications and New Media, added that such podcasts could provide a platform for individuals with differing political views to engage in candid exchange with one another – an important factor amid rising political polarisation worldwide. Pang also highlighted that some podcast hosts have been willing to challenge politicians on their shows, often voicing public concerns and asking pressing questions. Nevertheless, commentators on <i>CNA Today</i> noted that viral online content does not necessarily translate into electoral success, as voters have mixed opinions on its influence. Moreover, social media's reach is more confined to specific demographics, particularly younger voters.

<p>On 25 April, the <a href="/wiki/Infocomm_Media_Development_Authority" title="Infocomm Media Development Authority">Infocomm Media Development Authority</a> (IMDA) ordered <a href="/wiki/Meta_Platforms" title="Meta Platforms">Meta Platforms</a> to restrict Singaporeans' access to social media posts by foreign nationals it considered as <a href="/wiki/Foreign_electoral_intervention" title="Foreign electoral intervention">foreign interference</a> in the election. Among those accused of illegal campaigning were Malaysians <a href="/wiki/Iskandar_Abdul_Samad" title="Iskandar Abdul Samad">Iskandar Abdul Samad</a>, national treasurer of the <a href="/wiki/Malaysian_Islamic_Party" title="Malaysian Islamic Party">Malaysian Islamic Party</a> (PAS); Mohamed Sukri Omar, the PAS youth chief in <a href="/wiki/Selangor" title="Selangor">Selangor</a>; and Zulfikar bin Mohamad Shariff, an Australian citizen who renounced his Singapore citizenship in 2020. Iskandar had expressed support for WP MP <a href="/wiki/Faisal_Manap" title="Faisal Manap">Faisal Manap</a>, while Sukri reposted a post by Zulfikar criticising <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Malay_Singaporean" title="Malay Singaporean">Malay</a>-<a href="/wiki/Islam_in_Singapore" title="Islam in Singapore">Muslim</a> MPs for failing to represent Muslim interests. Senior minister of state <a href="/wiki/Zaqy_Mohamad" title="Zaqy Mohamad">Zaqy Mohamad</a> acknowleged that it might be a norm to mix religion with politics in other countries, but warned this could be disruptive if Singaporeans voted along religious lines. However, Iskandar denied the accusations that he was attempting to influence the election and "slammed" the attempt to link PAS to the WP. He stated that the post was "aimed at his predominantly Malay Muslim audience in Malaysia" rather than an "audience in Singapore". During a PAP walkabout in Tampines GRC on 29 April, Lee Hsien Loong said that race and religion should not be mixed with politics.
</p><p>In addition, a Singaporean Islamic religious teacher based in <a href="/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur" title="Kuala Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a>, Malaysia, Noor Deros, claimed that WP "had agreed to his political demands" after meeting with some of WP's Malay candidates. Pritam Singh denied this, adding that while WP has no control over foreigners supporting candidates, he pointed out that the party would be unsuccessful if they "<a href="/wiki/Race_card" title="Race card">play the race and religion card</a>". Other opposition parties, including the SDP, PSP and NSP, also stated their opposition to foreign interference, rejecting any foreign support. Deros denied trying to interfere in Singapore's politics and claimed to advocate on behalf of Singapore's "marginalised" Malay-Muslim community. Separately, one day after the restriction was imposed, RDU candidate Liyana Dhamirah lodged a police report for online harassment pertaining to "racist and sexist undertones".
</p><p>As of 29 April, around 5,000 comments posted by 900 fake Facebook accounts and <a href="/wiki/Internet_bot" title="Internet bot">bots</a> spreading anti-PAP and anti-WP sentiments and targeting news coverage of foreign interference were found, and MDDI urged the public to remain discern in handling consumers of information. On 30 April, Jom – an online publication website – was blocked due to a violation of promoting unauthorised third-party paid online election advertising (OEA) and the use of forbidden articles and materials, according to MDDI.

<p>This is the first general election under Lawrence Wong's leadership, with <i>SCMP</i> and <i>Nikkei Asia</i> describing the vote as "the first real test" of Singaporeans' confidence in the new prime minister. On 13 April, Wong acknowledged that the PAP would face a "fiercely contested" election, with no constituencies guaranteed as "safe seats" for the party. Wong also announced that the PAP would field at least 30 new candidates in the election – the largest slate in the party's recent history. Wong stated "profound changes" and growing global uncertainty as reasons for calling for the vote, allowing Singaporeans to choose a leadership team to navigate future challenges.
</p><p>On 17 April, the PAP launched their manifesto, which aimed to be a "roadmap" in navigating global uncertainties. To address costs of living, the PAP planned to distribute CDC vouchers, cash payouts, and utility rebates to households, while enhancing support schemes for lower-income families and seniors such as ComCare, Silver Support, and ComLink+. It will also reduce preschool fees, raise childcare subsidies, expand parental leave, and provide more support for larger families. The PAP aimed to support businesses facing rising costs with tax rebates and policies like the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme. It also proposes investment in transport, digital infrastructure, and clean energy (including nuclear) while accelerating tech adoption. For seniors, it proposes raising the re-employment age, increasing CPF contributions, and co-funding wages. PMETs – professionals, managers, executives and technicians – will receive help through leadership development, re-skilling initiatives, and jobseeker support under SkillsFuture. On housing, the PAP planned to build 50,000 new flats in the next three years, and offer more public housing options for higher-income couples and singles. It also planned to rejuvenate HDB towns through the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme.

<p>Thirty-two new PAP candidates were introduced in this election, which include a former <a href="/wiki/Nominated_Member_of_Parliament" title="Nominated Member of Parliament">Nominated Member of Parliament</a>, a former Chief of Army for the <a href="/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces" title="Singapore Armed Forces">Singapore Armed Forces</a>, six civil servants, a SAF <a href="/wiki/Chief_of_staff" title="Chief of staff">chief of staff</a>, and a <a href="/wiki/Mediacorp" title="Mediacorp">Mediacorp</a> news presenter. Nineteen PAP candidates stepped down at this election, which include four cabinet ministers <a href="/wiki/Ng_Eng_Hen" title="Ng Eng Hen">Ng Eng Hen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Maliki_Osman" title="Maliki Osman">Maliki Osman</a>, Senior Minister <a href="/wiki/Teo_Chee_Hean" title="Teo Chee Hean">Teo Chee Hean</a>, DPM <a href="/wiki/Heng_Swee_Keat" title="Heng Swee Keat">Heng Swee Keat</a>, Senior Ministers of State <a href="/wiki/Amy_Khor" title="Amy Khor">Amy Khor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Heng_Chee_How" title="Heng Chee How">Heng Chee How</a>, and five one-term MPs. <i>CNA Today</i> noted that their diverse backgrounds (two-fifths are women, and half of them are under 40) showed how the party is attempting to stay relevant in a changing political landscape. Teo believed the new candidates from the private sector highlighted PAP's increasing focus on community engagement and people-oriented industries. According to professor Terence Ho, the PAP strategically secured a walkover in Marine–Braddell Heights GRC on Nomination Day by redeploying anchor minister <a href="/wiki/Tan_See_Leng" title="Tan See Leng">Tan See Leng</a> to Chua Chu Kang GRC and sending DPM <a href="/wiki/Gan_Kim_Yong" title="Gan Kim Yong">Gan Kim Yong</a> in Punggol GRC to contest against the WP team.
</p><p>On PAP's first rally, Wong warned the opposition against inflaming sensitive issues or use domestic politics to cause political divisions especially during uncertain times. In his statement during the first PPB, Wong told the election comes "at a time of profound global change" and pledged to prioritise on important matters. Wong said voters would have to make a "crucial decision" for the country's future in the polls. On 25 April, Foreign Minister <a href="/wiki/Vivian_Balakrishnan" title="Vivian Balakrishnan">Vivian Balakrishnan</a>, who is campaigning in Holland–Bukit Timah GRC, urged opposition candidates to focus on offering real solutions, a statement later reiterated by Education Minister <a href="/wiki/Chan_Chun_Sing" title="Chan Chun Sing">Chan Chun Sing</a>. In another rally on 26 April, Youth Minister <a href="/wiki/Edwin_Tong" title="Edwin Tong">Edwin Tong</a>, who is contesting in East Coast GRC, insisted that there are no "silver bullet" for upcoming challenges and urged voters not to be swayed by rhetoric or soundbites promising easy solutions. At a 29 April rally, Home Affairs and Law Minister <a href="/wiki/K._Shanmugam" title="K. Shanmugam">K. Shanmugam</a> warned of job risks due to the <a href="/wiki/Tariffs_in_the_second_Trump_administration" title="Tariffs in the second Trump administration">U.S. tariffs</a> and urged the public to trust the government's budget measures, emphasising that the PAP "always tells the truth directly".
</p><p>At a lunchtime rally on 28 April, Wong warned that voting for the opposition would weaken the PAP by ousting ministers and accused the opposition of seeking more seats without responsibility. <a href="/wiki/Indranee_Rajah" title="Indranee Rajah">Indranee Rajah</a> claimed that opposition voices will still exist under the NCMP scheme, and pledged that the PAP government would continue providing support, such as CDC vouchers, GST vouchers, cash payouts, and utilities rebates, to address cost pressures which she deemed as "externally driven". Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong emphasised that a good government requires good people and urge voters against voting out key ministers during the times of uncertainties. On 29 April, Lee dismissed Singh's "ridiculous" claim that the government could function without a two-thirds majority. Wong also told on the media that WP's view of voting out ministers is a "cavalier and irresponsible approach". On 1 May, Wong refuted Singh's claims that negative politics was ingrained in the PAP's DNA, asserting instead that the party is committed to "forging as wide a national consensus" on contentious issues and "bringing Singaporeans together". Wong also emphasised that the effectiveness of policy debates in Parliament depends more on the quality of contributions than the number of voices.

<p>Addressing Singh's criticisms that labour MPs had ignored the controversial NTUC Income deal, NTUC secretary-general <a href="/wiki/Ng_Chee_Meng" title="Ng Chee Meng">Ng Chee Meng</a>, who is running in Jalan Kayu SMC, explained on 27 April that the deal was made "in good faith" and was considered "reasonable" as it was intended to strengthen Income and safefguard policyholders' interest. In light of public concerns, Ng said he had initiated a review within NTUC Enterprise and pledged that the organisation would "do better". Chan Chun Sing, who was a former NTUC secretary general, also defended labour MPs against the WP criticisms, stating they "work quietly behind the scenes" to represent workers and raise diverse issues in Parliament. He rejected Singh's claim that NTUC serves as a "trampoline" for losing PAP candidates and instead emphasised that voters should assess parties based on their ability to deliver jobs, wages, and price stability, and whether their proposals are realistic and financially sustainable. On 28 April, former NTUC <a href="/wiki/Income_Insurance" title="Income Insurance">Income Insurance</a> CEO <a href="/wiki/Tan_Suee_Chieh" title="Tan Suee Chieh">Tan Suee Chieh</a> published an <a href="/wiki/Open_letter" title="Open letter">open letter</a> calling for DPM Gan Kim Yong to provide full disclosure regarding his role in the deal; Tan's letter became viral across various social media platforms. In his <a href="/wiki/Labour_Day" title="Labour Day">Labour Day</a> speech on 1 May, Wong expressed gratitude to union workers, while also cautioning against voting out key ministers and urging voters to judge the PAP fairly. Separately, NTUC chief Ng Chee Meng reflected on his experiences over the five years between the two elections during his opening remarks. At the PAP's final rallies, Wong, who visited both the <a href="/wiki/North_Vista_Secondary_School" title="North Vista Secondary School">North Vista Secondary School</a> and <a href="/wiki/Yusof_Ishak_Secondary_School" title="Yusof Ishak Secondary School">Yusof Ishak Secondary School</a> to support the PAP teams contesting in Sengkang and Punggol, reiterated that this election is not a matter on how many seats they won, but it is about who they want to serve and form the government.
</p><p>According to PAP activists interviewed on <i>CNA Today,</i> their campaign strategy involved prioritising resources in the eastern and north-eastern electoral hotspots, avoiding personal attacks in favor of policy discussions, and leveraging incumbency strengths by emphasising consituency-level achievements. Felix Tan of NTU described Wong's first election campaign as "rather safe". Although his speeches lacked the gravitas of past leaders, Tan noted that Wong successfully highlighted the PAP's handling of the pandemic and its record on economic management. Elsewhere, several <a href="/wiki/Reddit" title="Reddit">Reddit</a> users began to question about PAP's campaigning strategies and criticized some of the teams for not campaigning hard in both <a href="/wiki/Safe_seat" title="Safe seat">safe seats</a> and <a href="/wiki/Marginal_seat" title="Marginal seat">battleground wards</a> in particular. Police are also currently investigating a man for the involvement of two children under the age of 16 in politics through the distribution of PAP flyers in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Punggol_GRC" title="Punggol GRC">Punggol GRC</a>, which is prohibited under Singaporean law.

<p>Following the dissolution of parliament, Pritam Singh thanked the residents of Aljunied, Hougang, and Sengkang for the "privilege of serving" them. Shortly after, the WP launched its campaign slogan "Working for Singapore", alongside a teaser video emphasising the need for political balance. Singh had also called for donations for its campaign, noting that costs for running a campaign had "risen considerably". On 16 April, the WP claimed that 15 policy proposals, which it had previously advocated for, were adopted "in some form" by the government, covering areas like housing, transport, and employment. SMU's associate professor Eugene Tan noted this move signals WP's campaign strategy – positioning itself as an effective, constructive opposition and suggesting it could achieve more with greater parliamentary presence. The PAP rejected WP claims, asserting that the ideas originated from its own MPs, and accused the WP of aligning itself with the ruling party's successes.
</p><p>On 17 April, the WP launched their manifesto which included 125 policy proposals. To address the cost of living, the WP called for <a href="/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_(Singapore)" title="Goods and Services Tax (Singapore)">Goods and Services Tax</a> (GST) exemptions on essential items and the introduction of a <a href="/wiki/Minimum_wage" title="Minimum wage">minimum wage</a> of S$1,600 (US$1194.03). Regarding economic concerns, the WP proposed recognising and valuing unpaid household labour to correct the perception that only paid work is meaningful. They also called for stronger leadership support in SMEs to improve talent attraction, the abolition of the statutory retirement age to give older workers more choice, and refinements to CPF policies, including allowing members to co-invest savings with GIC. On housing, the WP proposes using first-time buyers' median income to assess affordability, offering lower-priced 70-year <a href="/wiki/Build_to_order_(HDB)" title="Build to order (HDB)">Build-To-Order</a> (BTO) flats with a 29-year lease extension option, a universal buy-back scheme for ageing flats, and greater transparency in land valuation processes. Other proposals include the repeal of the <a href="/wiki/Internal_Security_Act_(Singapore)" title="Internal Security Act (Singapore)">Internal Security Act</a>, the enactment of Freedom of Information Act, and formal recognition of the State of Palestine.
</p><p>Singh also confirmed on 17 April that WP would field candidates for less than a third of parliamentary seats, 14 of which were new. On Nomination Day, the WP fielded its candidates to contest 26 seats in the GRCs of Punggol, Sengkang, Aljunied, Tampines, and East Coast, and the SMCs of Jalan Kayu, Tampines Changkat, and Hougang. Chairwoman <a href="/wiki/Sylvia_Lim" title="Sylvia Lim">Sylvia Lim</a> described the slate as the "most promising" group of candidates the party has fielded to date. Wong Pei Ting of <i>The Straits Times</i> noted the WP mounted a "considerably larger campaign" for 2025 compared to its 2020 campaign efforts.
</p><p>
However, the WP decided not to contest in Marine Parade–Braddell Heights GRC, which resulted in a <a href="/wiki/Walkover" title="Walkover">walkover</a> for the PAP. Singh explained that the party has to make the "difficult decision" due to its lack of resources and the extensive boundary changes of the constituency. The move was widely criticised by various opposition parties. PPP's chief <a href="/wiki/Goh_Meng_Seng" title="Goh Meng Seng">Goh Meng Seng</a> (who was formerly from WP) criticized Workers' Party as a "<a href="/wiki/Spoiler_effect" title="Spoiler effect">spoiler party</a>" for contesting against the PPP and the NSP in Tampines GRC, while chairman Derrick Sim was "dumbfounded" by WP's "lame excuse". Sim claimed that WP had never contested Tampines GRC since the ward's creation in 1988. NSP chief <a href="/wiki/Spencer_Ng" title="Spencer Ng">Spencer Ng</a> also criticised WP for the lack of opposition unity, mentioning it was now "close to impossible". SPP chief <a href="/wiki/Steve_Chia" title="Steve Chia">Steve Chia</a> expressed disappointment for the Marine Parade voters, saying that "every constituency benefits from active competition, since it fosters greater accountability". On the other hand, SDP chairman <a href="/wiki/Paul_Tambyah" title="Paul Tambyah">Paul Tambyah</a> and PSP chief <a href="/wiki/Leong_Mun_Wai" title="Leong Mun Wai">Leong Mun Wai</a> each respected their decision into putting their resources, given that WP had previously contested <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Marine_Parade_GRC" title="Marine Parade GRC">Marine Parade GRC</a> in the past two elections; it also added that the opposition will have to work onto strategies in the future election. Singh defended the criticisms on the following day, insisting that their lineup were being planned all along.</p><figure class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:File/Thumb"><a class="mw-file-description" href="/wiki/File:(SGP-Singapore)_Workers%27_Party_GE2025_Rally_at_Sengkang_GRC_2025-04-24.jpg"><img class="mw-file-element" data-file-height="3334" data-file-width="5926" decoding="async" height="141" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/%28SGP-Singapore%29_Workers%27_Party_GE2025_Rally_at_Sengkang_GRC_2025-04-24.jpg/250px-%28SGP-Singapore%29_Workers%27_Party_GE2025_Rally_at_Sengkang_GRC_2025-04-24.jpg" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/%28SGP-Singapore%29_Workers%27_Party_GE2025_Rally_at_Sengkang_GRC_2025-04-24.jpg/500px-%28SGP-Singapore%29_Workers%27_Party_GE2025_Rally_at_Sengkang_GRC_2025-04-24.jpg 1.5x" width="250"/></a><figcaption>WP rally for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sengkang_GRC" title="Sengkang GRC">Sengkang GRC</a> on 24 April.</figcaption></figure>
<p>According to Ang Qing and Kok Yufeng, the first WP rally on 24 April emphasised the importance of political competition and diverse perspectives, with former NCMP <a href="/wiki/Yee_Jenn_Jong" title="Yee Jenn Jong">Yee Jenn Jong</a> warning that the PAP sought to preserve its political dominance. Singh also urged voters to support WP despite global uncertainties, arguing that the WP has proven itself as a "force for good" during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. He emphasised that a stronger WP presence in Parliament would contribute to a more rational and responsive political landscape. In response to Wong's statement that there is already a sizeable opposition in Parliament, Singh emphasised WP's differing view – that one-third of Parliament should consist of opposition MPs – and argued that voters should compare PAP and WP <a href="/wiki/Backbencher" title="Backbencher">backbenchers</a> fairly. On his first PBB on 25 April, Singh said the WP winning more constituencies is vital for the future of Singapore's democracy. He explained that having more WP-held constituencies increases the likelihood of maintaining a fully elected opposition presence in Parliament over the long term, which would strengthen the stability and sustainability of Singapore's political system. On 27 April, Singh said if the PAP requires a supermajority to govern properly, it signals a "serious problem" in both the party's processes and Singapore's political system. On 1 May, Singh also said that even if all WP candidates were elected, the PAP would still hold a significant majority, undermining PAP's concerns about weakened governance.

<p>At their second rally on 26 April, WP reiterated its call for GST exemptions on essential items like cooking oil and rice, and proposed drawing more from Singapore's investment returns to address the rising cost of living. Singh also criticised PAP's manifesto for being "short on substance and specifics" and "loaded with motherhood statements". At their third rally on 28 April, the WP targeted DPM Gan Kim Yong and <a href="/wiki/Janil_Puthucheary" title="Janil Puthucheary">Janil Puthucheary</a> as they criticised the ruling party on issues such as the scrapped Income–Allianz deal and the "parachuting" of candidates into GRCs, particularly Punggol. At the fourth rally, Singh pushed back against Wong's accusation that the WP engaged in "negative politics", asserting instead that the party had been denied access to community clubs for its events. Meanwhile, the WP East Coast candidates criticised the constituency's repeated <a href="/wiki/Gerrymandering" title="Gerrymandering">gerrymandering</a> and called on voters to counter it by electing the WP.
</p><p>On 30 April, leaked screenshots of <a href="/wiki/Telegram_(software)" title="Telegram (software)">Telegram</a> messages from WP Jalan Kayu candidate Andre Low showed him using profanities while criticising the civil service and various Singaporean brands including <a href="/wiki/Singtel" title="Singtel">Singtel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Secretlab" title="Secretlab">SecretLab</a>, and celebrities such as <a href="/wiki/Pornsak_Prajakwit" title="Pornsak Prajakwit">Pornsak</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mark_Lee_(Singaporean_actor)" title="Mark Lee (Singaporean actor)">Mark Lee</a>; Low later apologised for the incident which he regarded as a "humbling experience". At their last rally on 1 May held at <a href="/wiki/Anderson_Serangoon_Junior_College" title="Anderson Serangoon Junior College">Anderson Serangoon Junior College</a>, WP candidates urged voters to base their decisions "on hope" instead of fear, with Sylvia Lim emphasizing the need for "conviction and hope" for a better future. Singh also criticised the GRC system for giving PAP candidates a "free pass" and stressed the importance of fighting for every vote, citing their narrow victory in Aljunied during the 2015 elections. Former chief <a href="/wiki/Low_Thia_Khiang" title="Low Thia Khiang">Low Thia Khiang</a> made a special appearance at the end of the rally before the recitation of the <a href="/wiki/National_Pledge_(Singapore)" title="National Pledge (Singapore)">national pledge</a>.
</p><p>Jaipragas described the PAP–WP rivalry as a "clear arc", which began steadily and calmly before coming to "a decisive sharpening at the midpoint". Nevertheless, he noted that the sharpened rhetoric, absence of racial politics, fearmongering, or intimidation, marked a healthy step forward in Singapore's democratic development. Political analysts on <i>The Straits Times</i> characterised the WP campaign strategy as both ambitious yet conservative, which yielded mixed outcomes. While WP consolidated its grip on its existing seats, it still saw a decline in its vote share.

<p>On 6 April, the <a href="/wiki/Progress_Singapore_Party" title="Progress Singapore Party">Progress Singapore Party</a> (PSP) launched its election manifesto "Progress for All", which included a call to revert the GST to 7%. Other proposed measures to deal with costs of living include setting rent guidelines for commercial properties and cap hawker stall rentals at S$500 or 3% of revenue. The PSP also proposed phasing out social enterprise hawker centres which they regarded as "costly". On healthcare, the PSP called to centralise drug procurement to cut costs, and provide cash support for new mothers to cover confinement expenses. To tackle economic concerns, the PSP proposed removing non-compete clauses for retrenched workers and mandating legally enforceable retrenchment benefits. It also called for shorter working hours, more paid leave and public holidays for better work-life balance, and equal parental leave for both parents. On housing, the PSP proposed replacing the current BTO system with its Affordable Homes Scheme, where land costs are excluded unless the flat is resold. It also advocated allowing singles aged 28 to buy BTO and resale flats, introducing a Millennial Apartments Scheme to offer quality rental flats for youths, and building more public housing in advance. Regarding immigration, the PSP proposes setting company-based quotas for Employment Pass (EP) holders. It also advocates strengthening the Fair Consideration Framework and introducing a levy on EP holders to better protect local workers and ensure fairer competition.
</p><p>The PSP also confirmed that it would field 13 candidates, fewer than 24 from the previous election, due to manpower issues. They announced they would compete in the SMCs of Kebun Baru, Marymount, Pioneer, and the GRCs of Bukit Gombak, Chua Chu Kang, and West Coast–Jurong West. Upon the dissolution of parliament on 15 April, the PSP declared its readiness to face voter scrutiny, highlighting its parliamentary track record of having "fought hard" for citizens' interests. On the following day after nominations, <a href="/wiki/Leong_Mun_Wai" title="Leong Mun Wai">Leong Mun Wai</a> challenged <a href="/wiki/Desmond_Lee_(Singaporean_politician)" title="Desmond Lee (Singaporean politician)">Desmond Lee</a> to a debate about public policies, only for the PAP to turn down.

<p>During their first rally on 25 April, Tan and Leong claimed that the PAP's fourth-generation has "lost its way" and added their issues and problems that have arise in the previous term, citing "a general decline in the standards". Minister <a href="/wiki/Tan_See_Leng" title="Tan See Leng">Tan See Leng</a> defended their claims and advised PSP to "keep up closely" on their policies and current trends, and highlighted said policies to further support it.

Poa later criticised the lack of transparency surrounding these incidents, which she termed "Gombakgate".
</p><p>On theis last rally on 1 May, Leong said that defeated opposition candidates "may be lost forever" unlike the PAP candidates, where they remain as grassroots advisors, further emphasising the need of the opposition.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Singapore_Democratic_Party" title="Singapore Democratic Party">Singapore Democratic Party</a> (SDP) criticised the "impossibly short" schedule between the release of the EBRC report and Parliament's dissolution, calling the election timing a "smash-and-grab tactic". It claimed the ruling party feared the people's backlash against the high cost of living and its "irrational immigration policy", and argued that voters require adequate time to properly assess critical issues before heading to the polls. The party plans to contest in Sembawang, Marsiling–Yew Tee, and Holland–Bukit Timah GRCs and Sembawang West and Bukit Panjang SMCs as part of their "northern strategy". On 19 April, the SDP launched its campaign slogan, "Thrive, Not Just Survive", and plans to campaign for the reduction of GST to 5% and introduce a minimum wage act. SDP fielded 11 candidates this election but did not contest in Holland–Bukit Timah.
</p><p>In SDP's rallies, the party slammed the PAP's policies.

In their final rally on 1 May, SDP targets the NTUC–PAP relationships and advocate labour workers, in response to Wong's Labour Day rally. At the closing, SDP asked to vote for them without fear, before reciting the National Pledge as well.
</p><p>On 27 April, SDP's Marsiling–Yew Tee GRC candidate Gigene Wong apologised for using <i><a href="/wiki/Keling" title="Keling">keling</a></i>, a <a href="/wiki/Hokkien" title="Hokkien">hokkien</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Racial_slur" title="Racial slur">racial slur</a> used to define <a href="/wiki/Tamils" title="Tamils">Tamils</a>, against her fellow candidate Ariffin Sha (whom she also called an "<a href="/wiki/Elephant" title="Elephant">elephant</a>" and "future <a href="/wiki/Pritam_Singh" title="Pritam Singh">Pritam Singh</a>") during the rally on the previous night.

It also considered the election an "opportunity" for citizens to articulate their policy concerns, societal aspirations, and grievances. The party planned to contest in Bishan–Toa Payoh and Potong Pasir. On 19 April, the SPP launched their manifesto which called for minimum wage, reducing <a href="/wiki/National_service_in_Singapore" title="National service in Singapore">National Service</a> to 18 months and lowering the eligibility age for singles to purchase public housing to 30.

He noted this timing disadvantages opposition parties, as they cannot respond to announcements made during the rally before cooling-off day on 2 May. Despite these concerns, Philemon affirmed RDU's readiness to contest the election. It intended to contest in Jurong East–Bukit Batok, Jurong Central, and Holland–Bukit Timah. On Nomination Day, RDU fielded 15 candidates to challenge in these five constituencies.
</p><p>RDU tackled bread-and-butter issues, the Malay-Muslim community, and the expenditure of <a href="/wiki/Founders%27_Memorial" title="Founders' Memorial">Founders' Memorial</a> on their first rally on 26 April. Members like Fazli Talip and Kala Manickam reiterated the importance of election of such candidates. In <a href="/wiki/The_Straits_Times" title="The Straits Times"><i>The Straits Times</i></a>' <i>The Usual Podcast</i> episode on 29 April, RDU discussed about their election campaign, and how they handled an online harassment after candidate Liyana Dhamirah was harassed online during campaigning. On another rally on 29 April, RDU focused on foreign minister <a href="/wiki/Vivian_Balakrishnan" title="Vivian Balakrishnan">Vivian Balakrishnan</a>'s comment to a post made by former NMP <a href="/wiki/Calvin_Cheng" title="Calvin Cheng">Calvin Cheng</a> on pro-Palestine remarks, and environment minister <a href="/wiki/Grace_Fu" title="Grace Fu">Grace Fu</a>'s "<a href="/wiki/Buffalo_wing" title="Buffalo wing">chicken wing</a>" comment in her rally speech the day before.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Power_Party_(Singapore)" title="People's Power Party (Singapore)">People's Power Party</a> (PPP) launched its manifesto on 4 April titled "Make Singapore Home Again", outlining tighter immigration policies, a revision of <a href="/wiki/Central_Provident_Fund" title="Central Provident Fund">Central Provident Fund</a> (CPF) contributions and "pro-family policy proposals" such as a monthly payout for children from lower-income families. The manifesto also proposed replacing the existing first past the post system with <a href="/wiki/Proportional_representation" title="Proportional representation">proportional representation</a> for parliamentary elections. The PPP expressed disappointment with the short timeframe between the issuance of the Writ of Election and Nomination Day, claiming that the PAP planned to "capitalise on the fear" of the US tariffs. Previously on 12 April, PPP secretary-general <a href="/wiki/Goh_Meng_Seng" title="Goh Meng Seng">Goh Meng Seng</a> said that the government had "overreacted" to the tariffs and claimed Singapore should "calmly wait out" as the tariffs would be withdrawn. The party plans to contest in Tampines and Ang Mo Kio. PPP had contested 10 seats, and like NSP, both contests in Ang Mo Kio and Tampines GRCs had multi-cornered fights. After nominations ended, PPP placed their election posters in the neighbouring <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aljunied_GRC" title="Aljunied GRC">Aljunied GRC</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tampines_Changkat_SMC" title="Tampines Changkat SMC">Tampines Changkat SMC</a>, a violation of the election advertising guidelines where posting outside contested constituencies is strictly prohibited; PPP had three hours upon notice to have it removed for a waiver of removal expenses.
</p><p>In PPP's first rally on 25 April, Goh attacked WP's Singh for abandoning the residents of Marine Parade and reminded him to "be humble". Goh later claimed he wasn't interested in him and deflected accusations of being "<a href="/wiki/Gay" title="Gay">gay</a>". The same day, Goh revealed that Derrick Sim's Facebook page has been disabled and subsequently lodged a police report for interference.
</p><p>In response to public scrutiny over his road rage conviction in 2022, PPP candidate Samuel Lee, who is contesting in Ang Mo Kio, apologised and appealed for public support, while party chairman Derrick Sim backed him, describing Lee as a "responsible person" with "a good heart.". In their third rally, Goh criticised the transport system after various incidents occurred such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/2024_East-West_MRT_line_disruption" title="2024 East-West MRT line disruption">2024 East–West MRT line disruption</a>. In their final rally, Goh aimed to convert the GRC system from <a href="/wiki/General_ticket" title="General ticket">general ticket</a> to a <a href="/wiki/Proportional_representation" title="Proportional representation">proportional representation</a> and also criticised PAP for recruiting civil servants and military professionals such as <a href="/wiki/David_Neo" title="David Neo">David Neo</a>, running the risk of group-thinking within the government; Goh also vowed to contest Marine Parade–Braddell Heights GRC in the next election, disregarding the outcome, as Goh has been noted for repeatedly attacking WP throughout all of the rallies.

<p><a href="/wiki/Singapore_Democratic_Alliance" title="Singapore Democratic Alliance">Singapore Democratic Alliance</a> (SDA) chairman <a href="/wiki/Desmond_Lim" title="Desmond Lim">Desmond Lim</a> said the party is prepared with 200 volunteers ready to serve as polling and counting agents. It planned to hold its rallies online instead of physical rallies to accommodate elderly residents. On 23 March, the party announced it would contest in Pasir Ris–Changi and was in negotiations with the WP over contesting in Punggol. On nomination day, SDA withdraw their bid into contesting Punggol GRC and only contested in Pasir Ris–Changi.
</p><p>In its series of videos, SDA highlighted key issues such as high living costs, high HDB flat prices, unaffordable healthcare, and inadequate good job opportunities, and pledged to hold the government accountable in its expenditure while ensuring "every young family could afford a home". The SDA also proposed imposing a levy on Employment Pass holders, with the money used to fund a S$1,600 base allowance for full-time national servicemen. Lim and the party reaffirmed their commitment to addressing the concerns of residents in Pasir Ris–Changi, pledging to offer a "choice" that represents "a different path of compassion, fairness, and a Singapore where every heart beats with hope".

The Alliance plans to contest in the GRCs of Jalan Besar, Tanjong Pagar, and the SMCs of Mountbatten, Potong Pasir, Queenstown, Radin Mas, and Yio Chu Kang. PAR contested 13 seats, with Lim contesting in Potong Pasir against SPP and PAP.
</p><p>In his PBB statement, Lim said the PAR has solutions to lower living costs and restore affordable housing, adding that Singaporeans seek "meaningful" solutions, not handouts, and reject a future worse than previous generations. Though he did not explain how PAR's policies would be funded, he claimed Singapore has enough money to support them without raising taxes or using reserves. At a 26 April rally, Lim urged Singaporeans to vote for opposition candidates to challenge "unjust PAP policies", pledging to fight like "a tiger and a lion" in Parliament on issues like living costs, housing, jobs, and immigration. Lim also criticised the Founders' Memorial, a "bloated civil service", and "empty" <a href="/wiki/Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)" title="Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)">Mass Rapid Transit</a> stations as wasteful spending. Lim also pledged to cut down on immigration. Other PAR candidates at the rally proposed rent control and freezing land costs to address living costs.

</p><p>Darryl Lo, the other independent candidate in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radin_Mas_SMC" title="Radin Mas SMC">Radin Mas SMC</a>, did not host any physical rallies. Instead, he planned to reach voters by distributing 15,000 flyers and putting up 200 posters with the help of 12 volunteers. While admitting he lacks political presence, Lo said he chose to run solo due to the absence of a credible opposition in the constituency. Lo said he will advocate for tougher penalties for drink driving, and aims to help more low-income families in Radin Mas qualify for the Education Ministry’s financial assistance scheme. In addition, he supports allowing singles aged 21 and above to purchase HDB flats. Lo had also rejected donations, saying he wanted to rely solely on his own efforts and stand on his own merits.

<p>At the post-election press conference at <a href="/wiki/AXA_Tower" title="AXA Tower">The Treasury</a>, prime minister Lawrence Wong said the results reflected a "clear and strong" mandate, placing Singapore in a better position to navigate uncertainties and multiracial issues. He described the outcome as a sign of public satisfaction but emphasised that the PAP does not take voters' support for granted and pledged to work harder, noting that the world was watching the results closely. Wong also acknowledged the opposition's efforts in addressing key issues. Separately, president <a href="/wiki/Tharman_Shanmugaratnam" title="Tharman Shanmugaratnam">Tharman Shanmugaratnam</a> said the results showed Singaporeans "remain united in wanting the best future for the country", noting the absence of political distrust or polarisation seen in other countries such as <a href="/wiki/2025_Canadian_federal_election" title="2025 Canadian federal election">Canada</a> and <a href="/wiki/2025_Australian_federal_election" title="2025 Australian federal election">Australia</a>. The following day, PAP leaders pledged to remain united and learn from global challenges while thanking residents via their parades, with <a href="/wiki/Meet-the-People_Sessions" title="Meet-the-People Sessions">Meet-the-People Sessions</a> resuming on 5 May.
</p><p>Pritam Singh of WP initially declined to speak to reporters regarding the election results. Nonetheless, in his victory speech for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aljunied_GRC" title="Aljunied GRC">Aljunied GRC</a> on 4 May, he pledged a more balanced parliament and that his team would continue to serve the residents equally. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jalan_Kayu_SMC" title="Jalan Kayu SMC">Jalan Kayu SMC</a> candidate Andre Low noted that while the outcome was "not what we hoped for", he respected it. Meanwhile, party supporters expressed surprise and disappointment as it was unable to win any new seats. WP congratulated PAP for the strong mandate. On 5 May, <a href="/wiki/Yee_Jenn_Jong" title="Yee Jenn Jong">Yee Jenn Jong</a> announced his retirement from politics, adding that his experience was "worthy", though he would remain in WP.
</p><p>SDP leader Chee secured the party's best result of 46.81% in Sembawang West SMC. However, he still failed to secure a parliamentary seat, including an NCMP position, as other WP in Jalan Kayu SMC and Tampines GRC achieved higher "losing" vote percentages. An emotional Chee described the campaign as an "uphill battle" but affirmed that the SDP and other opposition parties would continue to collaborate and adapt their strategies for future elections. On 18 May, Chee and Tambyah launched the "Orange and Teal Social Enterprise Co-operative" as a "people-centric economic counterweight to the PAP–NTUC nexus". They also advocated for electoral reforms via petitions and established a youth group in preparation for future elections.
</p><p>PSP chief Leong called the results "very shocking" as he acknowledged the party's loss across all six contested constituencies. He indicated the party would reflect and review its strategy while aiming to regain public trust and continue serving Singaporeans. PSP cancelled a press conference after the release of sample counts. On 4 May, PSP founder Tan Cheng Bock congratulated national development minister Desmond Lee's team on their victory. He also thanked their voters, saying that their support was "never taken for granted". Leong congratulated minister Lee via Facebook on 7 May, and stated that despite the disappointing results, it did not signify the end of the PSP. On 10 May, Tan confirmed his retirement from electoral politics but he would remain in PSP, saying that the party "is not going to run away".
</p><p>NSP chief <a href="/wiki/Spencer_Ng" title="Spencer Ng">Spencer Ng</a> declared on 3 May that the party would adopt a "more aggressive and vocal" approach against other opposition parties, acknowledging that "in an increasingly crowded opposition landscape", the NSP's voice risked being "overshadowed". Ng stated that "opposition unity is an illusion", and the NSP would no longer adhere to "gentlemen's rules", alleging that other parties had exploited this for their own gain.  PAR leader Lim Tean described the results as "disappointing not just for PAR but for the entire opposition" and vowed a stronger comeback in the next election. He also stated the party would investigate "certain inexplicable matters" and alleged there were unsigned ballot box seals in Potong Pasir SMC. RDU leader Philemon described the results as encouraging and congratulated prime minister Wong, characterising PAP's win as a "heavy responsibility". SDA leader Lim expressed his encouragement and motivation to continue community work, and outlined plans to enhance community engagement, refine policies, leverage social media, and build stronger coalitions with other parties to address constituents' issues. Independent candidates Jeremy Tan and Darryl Lo intended to use their platforms to continue engaging Singaporeans on local and national issues. Tan also plans to contest in the next election and pledged to advocate for low-income families in Mountbatten and Marine Parade. Lo, who outperformed PAR candidate Kumar Appavoo by 16 points, said the result showed voters wanted a more credible opposition candidate.
</p><p>A post-election survey by YouGov indicated that while most Singaporean voters were satisfied with the outcome, less than half of Gen Z voters approved of PAP's election victory. The survey also found that only 37% of Gen Z respondents felt optimistic about the future under the new administration.

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Results_analysis">Results analysis</h3></div>
<p>Analysts on <i>The Straits Times</i> regarded PAP's landslide victory as a "flight to safety". Additionally, analysts on <i>The Straits Times</i> and <i>CNA</i> believed the results indicated a "strong mandate" for Wong's leadership team. SMU Professor Eugene Tan noted that PAP's overall vote share increased, a reversal of the typical decline seen during a leadership transition. Political scientist Walid Jumblatt Abdullah believed the strong electoral performance gave Wong "wide latitude" in forming his cabinet, with other commentators considering PAP's leadership transition as "complete".
</p><p>Analysts interviewed on <i>CNA</i> suggested that the election results could signal a shift towards a <a href="/wiki/Two-party_system" title="Two-party system">two-party system</a> in Singapore, with Professor Tan highlighting the "increasingly crowded and fragmented opposition landscape". However, analysts differed on WP's performance. NUS Professor Chong Ja Ian noted WP's increased vote share in its incumbent constituencies, and IPS research fellow Teo Kay Key highlighted that the party secured over 40% of votes in all newly contested areas, both of which were cited as indicators of progress. However, former PAP MP <a href="/wiki/Inderjit_Singh_(Singaporean_politician)" title="Inderjit Singh (Singaporean politician)">Inderjit Singh</a> argued that WP's strong candidates remained overextended as the party failed to secure another GRC. On <i>Reuters</i>, analysts believed that the WP had emerged as the leading challenger against the PAP's longstanding dominance. Associate Professor Michael Barr praised the party's disciplined approach and ability to attract strong candidates while building electoral experience. However, Gillian Koh noted that despite pulling ahead of other opposition parties, the WP remains far from mounting a serious challenge to the PAP, positioning Singapore closer to a "one-and-a-half party system".
</p><p>Political observers on <i>CNA</i> also regarded the results as a "serious loss" for other opposition parties. The PSP lost its two NCMP seats and saw a decreased vote share from 41% to 36%. Political analyst Loke Hoe Yeong suggested the PSP was overdependent on Tan Cheng Bock's symbolic leadership, with NCMPs Poa and Leong failing to gain significant electoral momentum. Chong suggested that the party's reduced internet presence may have contributed to its decline, while Eugene Tan noted that the PSP, being a newer party, failed to effectively convey its youthful appeal. Political obsevers also noted PSP's struggle to recruit younger candidates and its misjudgment of the electorate's desire for policy debate. IPS academic adviser Tan Ern Ser said PSP's proposals may appeal to some but seem impractical to others, while observers noted the party's leadership changes have hurt perceptions of its stability.
</p><p>Tham Yuen-C of <i>The Straits Times</i> viewed the results as a rejection of poorly prepared "mosquito parties", with voters favouring credible opposition like the WP. Tham believed this signalled a desire for gradual political change and higher standards in opposition politics. Analysts on <i>CNA</i> cited poor candidate quality, weak ground presence, and unclear messaging as key reasons for the other parties' poor performance, and suggested they should consider consolidating or merging with larger opposition parties to stay relevant. Eugene Tan added that while RDU's performance was a "promising start", the party must grow further by broadening its appeal and recruiting candidates from diverse racial and social backgrounds.
</p><p>Various analysts on <i>The Straits Times</i> also highlighted voters' rising expectations for strong parliamentary representation and effective municipal management. SUSS associate professor Walter Theseira noted noted the WP retained support by improving estate management, while Eugene Tan described PSP's dismissive attitude toward local governance as "untenable". Michelle Ang added that even independent candidates with local credibility outperformed some established opposition figures.

<p>Lawrence Wong stated that his immediate priority was to form the new cabinet, which will be announced "in due course" through a press conference and followed by a swearing-in ceremony. He also indicated that NTUC secretary-general Ng Chee Meng is likely to be included, citing the precedent of labour chiefs playing key roles in past Cabinets. On 5 May, Wong also announced that <a href="/wiki/Pritam_Singh" title="Pritam Singh">Pritam Singh</a> would remains as the <a href="/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_(Singapore)" title="Leader of the Opposition (Singapore)">opposition leader</a>.

Ng apologised for his "disrespectful" remarks made to public servants at a 2017 Ministry of Education dialogue.
</p><p>On 19 May, the WP announced that <a href="/wiki/Eileen_Chong_(politician)" title="Eileen Chong (politician)">Eileen Chong</a> and <a href="/wiki/Andre_Low" title="Andre Low">Andre Low</a> would accept the roles for the NCMP, which was confirmed by returning officer Han on that day. Wong announced the new cabinet line-up on 21 May. Three new coordinating ministers were appointed with Gan Kim Yong as the only DPM. Chan Chun Sing assumed roles as defence minister and coordinating minister for public services, while Desmond Lee took over education and Chee Hong Tat became national development minister. Ong Ye Kung became coordinating minister for social policies, and K Shanmugam was appointed coordinating minister for national security, with Edwin Tong taking over law and also serving as second minister for home affairs. Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim was promoted to senior minister of state for home affairs and acting minister-in-charge of Muslim affairs. Newly-elected MPs <a href="/wiki/Jeffrey_Siow" title="Jeffrey Siow">Jeffrey Siow</a> and <a href="/wiki/David_Neo" title="David Neo">David Neo</a> became acting ministers for transport and culture, community and youth respectively.
