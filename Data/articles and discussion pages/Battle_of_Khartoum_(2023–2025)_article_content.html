<p>The <b>Battle of Khartoum</b> was a major <a href="/wiki/Strategy" title="Strategy">strategic</a> battle for control of <a href="/wiki/Khartoum" title="Khartoum">Khartoum</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Capital_city" title="Capital city">capital</a> of <a href="/wiki/Sudan" title="Sudan">Sudan</a>, with fighting in and around the city between the paramilitary <a href="/wiki/Rapid_Support_Forces" title="Rapid Support Forces">Rapid Support Forces</a> (RSF), and the <a href="/wiki/Sudanese_Armed_Forces" title="Sudanese Armed Forces">Sudanese Armed Forces</a> (SAF), as part of the <a href="/wiki/Sudanese_civil_war_(2023%E2%80%93present)" title="Sudanese civil war (2023–present)">civil war</a>. The battle began on 15 April 2023, after the RSF <a href="/wiki/RSF_occupation_of_the_Khartoum_International_Airport" title="RSF occupation of the Khartoum International Airport">captured</a> <a href="/wiki/Khartoum_International_Airport" title="Khartoum International Airport">Khartoum International Airport</a>, several military bases, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Presidential_Palace,_Khartoum" title="Presidential Palace, Khartoum">presidential palace</a> in an attempted <a href="/wiki/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat" title="Coup d'état">coup d'état</a>, starting an escalating series of clashes. The battle was also the longest continuous battle in Sudanese history, the longest battle in an African capital ever, the longest in North African history and is one of the deadliest recorded battles in Sudanese and African history, with over 61,000 deaths.

</p><p>It was initially reported that tensions rose in <a href="/wiki/Khartoum" title="Khartoum">Khartoum</a> and <a href="/wiki/Merowe,_Sudan" title="Merowe, Sudan">Merowe</a> on 13 April 2023, when RSF forces mobilized. In response, the SAF issued a statement saying "There is a possibility of a confrontation between SAF and RSF forces" introducing fears of a wider conflict. In the evening of 14 April 2023, RSF forces assaulted the Khartoum International Airport, a military base, and the presidential palace. The fighting spread from Khartoum into its suburbs, primarily <a href="/wiki/Omdurman" title="Omdurman">Omdurman</a>, where its bridge on the White Nile was largely captured by the RSF forces.

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Background">Background</h2></div>
<p><a href="/wiki/Khartoum" title="Khartoum">Khartoum</a> is the capital and largest city in <a href="/wiki/Sudan" title="Sudan">Sudan</a>, with over 5 million residents. The Khartoum metropolitan area is made up of three main areas: Khartoum, <a href="/wiki/Omdurman" title="Omdurman">Omdurman</a> to the northwest, on the west bank of the <a href="/wiki/Nile" title="Nile">Nile</a>, is the second most populous city in Sudan, and <a href="/wiki/Khartoum_North" title="Khartoum North">Khartoum North</a>, colloquially known as Bahri, located north of Khartoum itself.
</p><p>While the Khartoum area has experienced civil unrest, violent protests and state repression, the area usually has been spared from warfare, with a major exception being the <a href="/wiki/2008_Omdurman_attack" title="2008 Omdurman attack">2008 Omdurman attack</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Justice_and_Equality_Movement" title="Justice and Equality Movement">Justice and Equality Movement</a> during the <a href="/wiki/War_in_Darfur" title="War in Darfur">War in Darfur</a>.
</p><p>In 2013, the <a href="/wiki/Janjaweed" title="Janjaweed">Janjaweed</a>, a pro-Bashir militia composed predominantly of Arabs and notorious for their role in the <a href="/wiki/Darfur_genocide" title="Darfur genocide">Darfur genocide</a>, was organized into the paramilitary <a href="/wiki/Rapid_Support_Forces" title="Rapid Support Forces">Rapid Support Forces</a> to fight rebels in the <a href="/wiki/Nuba_Mountains" title="Nuba Mountains">Nuba Mountains</a>. The RSF is led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as <a href="/wiki/Hemedti" title="Hemedti">Hemedti</a>.
</p><p>In 2019, popular uprisings against the <a href="/wiki/Omar_al-Bashir" title="Omar al-Bashir">Omar al-Bashir</a> regime began across Sudan, especially in Khartoum. The Sudanese government, aided by the RSF, shot at protesters, killing dozens of people over a period of several months in Khartoum and Omdurman. The deadliest incident was in Khartoum on 3 June, where Sudanese soldiers and the RSF <a href="/wiki/Khartoum_massacre" title="Khartoum massacre">killed over 100 civilians</a> protesting the regime. Bashir was eventually overthrown, and a transitional civilian-military administration was put in place, with <a href="/wiki/Abdalla_Hamdok" title="Abdalla Hamdok">Abdalla Hamdok</a> becoming the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Sudan" title="Prime Minister of Sudan">Prime Minister of Sudan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Abdel_Fattah_al-Burhan" title="Abdel Fattah al-Burhan">Abdel Fattah al-Burhan</a> becoming the Commander in Chief of the <a href="/wiki/Sudanese_Armed_Forces" title="Sudanese Armed Forces">Sudanese Armed Forces</a> and the Chairman of the <a href="/wiki/Transitional_Sovereignty_Council" title="Transitional Sovereignty Council">Transitional Sovereignty Council</a>.
</p><p>
In 2021, Burhan, along with Hemedti, overthrew the civilian administration in the <a href="/wiki/2021_Sudanese_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat" title="2021 Sudanese coup d'état">2021 Sudanese coup d'état</a>, cementing military rule over Sudan. By 2023, tensions between Burhan and Hemedti increased after Burhan's pressure to integrate the RSF into the Sudanese military, whereas Hemedti preferred autonomy for the RSF. On 13 April, rumors spread of RSF fighters mobilizing at bases in Khartoum and <a href="/wiki/Merowe,_Sudan" title="Merowe, Sudan">Merowe</a>. By 14 April, both groups had tens of thousands of fighters in Khartoum each. These tensions came to a head on 15 April 2023, after RSF fighters attacked civilian and military sites across the nation, including Khartoum and Omdurman.</p><figure class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:File/Thumb"><a class="mw-file-description" href="/wiki/File:Khartoum_Airport_and_the_street_of_Africa.jpg"><img class="mw-file-element" data-file-height="2429" data-file-width="4000" decoding="async" height="152" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Khartoum_Airport_and_the_street_of_Africa.jpg/250px-Khartoum_Airport_and_the_street_of_Africa.jpg" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Khartoum_Airport_and_the_street_of_Africa.jpg/500px-Khartoum_Airport_and_the_street_of_Africa.jpg 1.5x" width="250"/></a><figcaption><a href="/wiki/Khartoum_International_Airport" title="Khartoum International Airport">Khartoum International Airport</a>, where the first attacks were reported on 15 April 2023, was under RSF control until March 2025.</figcaption></figure>

In the early hours of the morning of 15 April 2023, the Rapid Support Forces initiated a series of assaults on key installations in Khartoum, including the Khartoum International Airport. During the attack on the airport, the RSF reportedly fired on a <a href="/wiki/Saudia" title="Saudia">Saudia</a> airliner which was arriving at the airport, but no casualties were reported among the aircraft's passengers and crew. The RSF also captured the presidential palace, the residence of former Sudanese president <a href="/wiki/Omar_al-Bashir" title="Omar al-Bashir">Omar al-Bashir</a>, and attacked a military base. In the fighting at the Khartoum airport, two civilians were killed. Hemedti claimed that the RSF controlled most of the city's government buildings, but this was disputed by Burhan.</p><figure class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:File/Thumb"><a class="mw-file-description" href="/wiki/File:Battle_of_Khartoum_(April_2023).svg"><img class="mw-file-element" data-file-height="421" data-file-width="540" decoding="async" height="195" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Battle_of_Khartoum_%28April_2023%29.svg/250px-Battle_of_Khartoum_%28April_2023%29.svg.png" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Battle_of_Khartoum_%28April_2023%29.svg/500px-Battle_of_Khartoum_%28April_2023%29.svg.png 1.5x" width="250"/></a><figcaption>Military situation in Khartoum in April 2023; blue highlights areas of RSF activity</figcaption></figure>
<p>RSF fighters stormed Burhan's residence as well on 15 April, attempting to assassinate him. Burhan and his bodyguards fought back, with a bodyguard later stating that Burhan himself picked up an <a href="/wiki/AK-47" title="AK-47">AK-47</a> and shot at the RSF. While Burhan escaped the fighting safely, over 30 of his bodyguards were killed in the clashes.
</p><p>The same day, several aerial attacks towards the RSF targets were conducted by the SAF. Users on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Facebook_Live" title="Facebook Live">Facebook Live</a> and <a href="/wiki/Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> documented the <a href="/wiki/Sudanese_Air_Force" title="Sudanese Air Force">Sudanese Air Force</a> flying above the city, and striking the RSF targets. On 16 April, the Armed Forces claimed to have re-captured the presidential palace, a claim disputed by the RSF who posted a video on <a href="/wiki/Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> of their continued presence in the palace amidst ongoing fighting. The RSF also disputed claims that several other buildings had been captured by the Armed Forces. The Interior Ministry building was also said to have come under RSF occupation.
</p><p>On 17 April, students from <a href="/wiki/Comboni_College_of_Science_%26_Technology" title="Comboni College of Science &amp; Technology">Comboni College of Science &amp; Technology</a> were evacuated after fighting reached the campus. That same day, the <a href="/wiki/Forces_of_Freedom_and_Change" title="Forces of Freedom and Change">Forces of Freedom and Change</a> stated that negotiations were no longer going on between Hemedti and Burhan. In a statement, Hemedti claimed to be fighting against Islamists, and championing himself as a leader of democracy. Students at other university students were forced to flee through gates following attacks and clashes at their campuses. At the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Khartoum" title="University of Khartoum">University of Khartoum</a>, one student, Khalid al-Tageea, was buried on campus after shelling hit and killed him, and it was impossible to transport his body.
</p><p>At the Khartoum Teaching Hospital, one of the largest in the city, the building was besieged by the RSF. It shut down completely on 17 April along with the sister al-Shaab Teaching Hospital due to RSF shelling hitting and damaging the building. In al-Moallem hospital, residents and staff were forced to flee following RSF attacks on the hospital. Staff alleged the shelling was deliberate. In Bahri's International Hospital, the director took to social media for fuel donations as power had been cut to the neighborhood. By 18 April 39 of the 59 hospitals in Khartoum were out of service, and the remaining twenty were in Omdurman.
</p><p>On 16 April, General Yassir El Atta announced that all RSF camps in Khartoum were under SAF control, along with <a href="/wiki/Port_Sudan" title="Port Sudan">Port Sudan</a>, <a href="/wiki/El-Gadarif" title="El-Gadarif">El-Gadarif</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Kosti,_Sudan" title="Kosti, Sudan">Kosti</a>.

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading4"><h4 id="International_incidents_and_reactions">International incidents and reactions</h4></div>
<p>On 17 April, the Sudanese government announced the closure of Sudan's airspace, initially limited solely to that of Khartoum. <a href="/wiki/Aidan_O%27Hara" title="Aidan O'Hara">Aidan O'Hara</a>, the <a href="/wiki/List_of_ambassadors_of_the_European_Union" title="List of ambassadors of the European Union">European Union ambassador to Sudan</a>, was assaulted at his Khartoum home where he had been sheltering. The EU declared the attack, "a gross violation of the 1961 <a href="/wiki/Vienna_Convention_on_Diplomatic_Relations" title="Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations">Vienna Convention</a>." The same day, a US diplomatic convoy was fired upon in an incident labeled as "reckless" by <a href="/wiki/Antony_Blinken" title="Antony Blinken">Antony Blinken</a>. General al-Burhan declared the Rapid Support Forces a "rebel group", and ordered their nationwide dissolution. On 17 April, South Sudanese president <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Salva_Kiir" title="Salva Kiir">Salva Kiir</a> cancelled a planned trip to Khartoum due to the fighting. RSF forces also besieged and shelled a large hospital in the city. The <a href="/wiki/World_Food_Programme" title="World Food Programme">World Food Programme</a> also halted operations in the country.
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading4"><h4 id="Omdurman">Omdurman</h4></div>
<p>A doctor in Omdurman stated the situation was hectic and everyone was seeking shelter. RSF forces laid siege to the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Sudanese_Broadcasting_Corporation&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Sudanese Broadcasting Corporation (page does not exist)">Sudanese Broadcasting Corporation</a> headquarters in the city, and began shelling places where <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/SUNA" title="SUNA">SUNA</a> broadcasts. Shelling continued throughout Omdurman on 16 April. Many airstrikes came from the Sudanese Air Force against RSF bases across the city. That same day, RSF forces managed to enter and capture the SUNA building, and began airing pro-RSF content. The RSF broadcasts ended on 17 April as clashes continued around the area. Despite pro-SAF media claiming that Sudanese forces recaptured the headquarters, the RSF posted a video confirming their continued control over it.
</p><p>In other areas of Omdurman, RSF forces claimed to have vacated their base in the city. Videos from the city showed a barracks with dozens of wounded RSF fighters sprawled out across a makeshift barracks. Clashes also broke out on both ends of the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Halfaya_Bridge&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Halfaya Bridge (page does not exist)">Halfaya Bridge</a>, one of several that connects Omdurman to Khartoum. In the battles on Halfaya bridge, a hospital on Khartoum's side of the river was shelled. Locals stated that there were so many dead near the bridge, it was impossible to recover their bodies. The safest areas of Omdurman were allegedly the working-class neighborhoods.
</p><p>By 17 April, at least four people had been killed in clashes in Omdurman, according to the Sudanese Doctor's Union. Of the twenty hospitals in Khartoum and Omdurman, 12 were forced to close by 18 April due to indiscriminate shelling targeting the hospitals. That same day, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Shams_al-Din_Khabbashi" title="Shams al-Din Khabbashi">Shams El Din Kabbashi</a>, a member of the Sudanese sovereignty council, announced a 24-hour ceasefire between the SAF and RSF across the country.

<p>A ceasefire was announced on 18 April, but was ineffective. While it was set to go in effect at 6pm, fighting was still ongoing around the military headquarters, and the Republican Palace. Residents of Bahri also stated that fighting was occurring in their neighborhood, and wounded civilians were trapped in their homes. Some residents were out and about, and humanitarian agencies stated it was still impossible to provide aid. The <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Khartoum_State_Ministry_of_Health&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Khartoum State Ministry of Health (page does not exist)">Khartoum State Ministry of Health</a> stated that most medical facilities were on the verge of shutting down due to the crisis. Satellite images on 19 April showed several key sites in the Khartoum area shelled or destroyed. These included the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Security_Service_of_Sudan" title="Security Service of Sudan">Security Service of Sudan</a>, the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Ministry_of_Education_and_Scientific_Research_(Sudan)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Ministry of Education and Scientific Research (Sudan) (page does not exist)">Ministry of Education and Scientific Research</a>, the General Command, Kobar Bridge, and several other government offices. On 18 April, the Sudanese Army also stated that they dissolved the RSF, although this was in name only. In Khartoum in particular, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/SUNA" title="SUNA">SUNA</a> stated that the SAF was attempting to minimize civilian losses to lives and property from SAF airstrikes.
</p><p>On 19 April, battles continued in Khartoum near the army headquarters, the presidential palace, and the airport, with heavy weapons used. The Sudanese Army said it was attacked by the RSF at its general command headquarters, but had repelled the attack, inflicting "heavy losses" on the RSF, which had reportedly abandoned 24 vehicles. The SAF called on RSF forces to surrender with the promise of pardons. Observers determined that the army was controlling access to Khartoum and trying to cut off supply routes to RSF fighters. Witnesses said the army reinforcements were brought in from near the eastern border with <a href="/wiki/Ethiopia" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>. When another ceasefire was announced to begin at 18:00 local time, fighting was reported to have mostly subsided around Khartoum airport, but continued to be intense around the Presidential Palace, army headquarters, and in the Jabra neighborhood in western Khartoum, where houses belonging to Hemedti and his family were located. Fighting was reported to have continued several minutes after the start of the ceasefire.
</p><p>A <a href="/wiki/Reuters" title="Reuters">Reuters</a> reporter in Khartoum, stated that by 20 April, the main market in Bahri was burnt to the ground, and many buildings in the center of the city were destroyed or heavily damaged. Checkpoints by RSF fighters on blocks and the middle of city streets were frequent in Bahri and Omdurman, and civilian life was non-existent. Around the Halfaya Bridge, diplomats were evacuating the area, and buses taking residents to Egypt were stopping. These buses usually cost US$50, and increase on demand. Many residents fled to <a href="/wiki/Port_Sudan" title="Port Sudan">Port Sudan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wad_el-Mahi" title="Wad el-Mahi">Wad el-Madani</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chad" title="Chad">Chad</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>. Around this time, many diplomats were evacuating Khartoum. Greek and Cypriot personnel sheltered in a Greek Orthodox cathedral in Khartoum, and Egyptian, Dutch, and Saudi foreign ministries all sent planes to airlift their nationals.
</p><p>The RSF stated it repelled an SAF attack on positions in Omdurman on the morning of 20 April, claiming to have shot down two helicopters in the process. Fighting was also reported at the Sudanese Broadcasting Corporation headquarters in the city. RSF reinforcements approaching Khartoum from the west were blocked by Sudanese forces that same day. The main hotspots of fighting in Omdurman were in El Fitihab, Medinet El Nakhil, El Bustan, and the Libya Market Road. The RSF also had a heavy presence in the neighborhoods of El Mohandesin, Medinet El Nakhil, Aburiyal, El Salha, and blocks 18 and 19 of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ombada,_Sudan" title="Ombada, Sudan">Ombada</a>, west of Omdurman. The <a href="/wiki/Modus_operandi" title="Modus operandi">modus operandi</a> of the RSF in Omdurman was hit-and-run attacks, with ambushes on SAF soldiers and then hiding in residential areas and houses.
</p><p>In Khartoum that same day, RSF forces gained control of the roads leading to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Al_Jazirah_(state)" title="Al Jazirah (state)">El Gezira</a>, along with the roads leading to <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Soba_Bridge&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Soba Bridge (page does not exist)">Soba Bridge</a>. Locals mentioned that the RSF were in control of the Soba army garrison, and were actively fighting for the road to El Kamleen. Despite the <a href="/wiki/Eid_al-Fitr" title="Eid al-Fitr">Eid al-Fitr</a> ceasefire announced by both sides on 21 April, shelling and fighting still occurred in and around the General Command, the <a href="/wiki/Republican_Palace,_Khartoum" title="Republican Palace, Khartoum">Republican Palace</a>, and south of Khartoum International Airport. Clashes broke out again along the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Qawmy_Road&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Qawmy Road (page does not exist)">Qawmy Road</a>, the one connecting Khartoum to Gezira which had fallen under RSF control the day prior. Fighting was also reported in al-Bagair, an industrial area on the western side of the Nile, along with airstrikes in Bahri. Analysts predicted that the RSF had moved to hit-and-run tactics, and that there "were no strongholds" left in the Khartoum area for the group.

The group requested immediate aid, and stated RSF attacks and clashes intensified that day despite the Eid ceasefire. The fighting continued into 22 April, with heavy shelling reported in Ombda and Karari, north of Khartoum. Shelling from the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Corps_of_Engineers_(Sudan)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Corps of Engineers (Sudan) (page does not exist)">Corps of Engineers</a> in Ombada Mansoura killed six people. In central Khartoum, the fighting spread from the downtown to the neighborhoods of Hillat Hamad, Khojaly, and Arkaweet. The Sudanese army also continued air campaigns against RSF hideouts, reportedly preparing for intensified urban warfare. Clashes also spread around Khartoum, on the roads linking Khartoum to Wad al-Madani and Darfur. The Rapid Support Forces also released a statement accusing the SAF of attacking positions in Bahri, and claiming to have repulsed those attacks. The Republican Palace was also reportedly still a battleground.
</p><p>The al-Huda prison was attacked by the RSF sometime around 23 April, releasing all of the prisoners located at the facility, allegedly including former Sudanese president and war criminal <a href="/wiki/Omar_al-Bashir" title="Omar al-Bashir">Omar al-Bashir</a>. In the attack, the guards were killed. Other notable convicts were serving time for perpetrating war crimes throughout the War in Darfur. The Omdurman Women's Prison was also bombed around the same time, allowing many inmates to escape. On 23 April, at least 50 people were killed in the Khartoum area, and four were killed on 24 April. The Qatari and French foreign ministries were also attacked and looted on 24 April, which the SAF accused the RSF of.

</p><p>Clashes continued around the area of the General Command and the Republican Palace. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/WHO" title="WHO">WHO</a> representative to Sudan stated that on 25 April, one side had <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/National_Public_Health_Laboratory_crisis" title="National Public Health Laboratory crisis">seized control of a national health lab</a> in Khartoum that held biological materials including <a href="/wiki/Polio" title="Polio">polio</a>, <a href="/wiki/Measles" title="Measles">measles</a>, and cholera isolates, and that the group had ejected all technicians. The WHO did not mention which side took control, although the lab was close to fighting between the RSF and SAF. The Sudanese Ministry of Health also stated that the medical system in the country had collapsed by 24 April. Protests also broke out against both the SAF and RSF in Dardoug, northern Bahri, and Karari.

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Jeddah_ceasefire">Jeddah ceasefire</h2></div>
<p>On 20 May, the SAF and RSF signed a week-long, nationwide ceasefire at the culmination of the talks in Jeddah. The ceasefire was set to be implemented on 22 May, lasting until 29 May.

<p>Civilians in Khartoum often had to steal to survive, as all goods and services were near impossible to come by. Resistance committees made up the brunt of humanitarian aid in neighborhoods with heavy fighting, like Jabra. In many areas, disease was prevalent due to the heavy amount of decaying bodies left untouched in the streets. Water was near impossible to come by, and residents boiled water from the Nile. Retrieving water often meant putting themselves at risk of being shot by snipers. Street gangs were also common, with poorer neighborhoods being targeted. Prices of house staples also rose exponentially, with flour doubling in price, sugar rising to 50,000 Sudanese pounds (SDG) from 32,000, and cooking oil rising from 23,000 SDG to 35,000 SDG. Civilians in Bahri later began burying bodies through the aid of resistance committees, as the health ministry was nonexistent.

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading4"><h4 id="Battle_of_Yarmouk_factory">Battle of Yarmouk factory</h4></div>
<p>On 7 June, a fire broke out after clashes near <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Yarmouk_factory" title="Yarmouk factory">Yarmouk factory</a>, the largest weapons-producing factory in Sudan. The RSF alleged that the factory was also a weapons storage area for the SAF. The RSF attacked Sudanese trenches near the factory on 6 June, sparking the battle. The clashes had spread from the neighborhoods of Jabra, al-Shajara, and Abu Adam, which were the epicenters of fighting in southern Khartoum. The Sudanese army launched airstrikes and shelling towards the factory and oil depots in the neighborhood nearby, setting the depots and munitions on fire. The RSF released a statement later on 7 June claiming control over the Yarmouk factory, but residents and geolocated footage showed SAF soldiers in control of it on the night of 7 June. Analysts suggested that the attempts by the RSF to capture the Yarmouk factory and the oil depots were part of a wider goal to intensify their siege on the SAF Armored Corps base in al-Shajara. Others suggested that the RSF would attempt to attack Abu Adam and more of the neighborhood of al-Shajara. Following the battle of Yarmouk factory, SAF reinforcements arrived at the Armored Corps, but by 8 June, the RSF had already recaptured Yarmouk factory. The reinforcements came from the SAF's 17th division, 18th division, and elements of the 1st and 4th divisions.
</p><p>In other areas of Khartoum on 7 June, SAF airstrikes continued over the El Moweileh neighborhood of Omdurman and clashes resumed in Sharq El Nil.

On the night of 7 June, five worshippers at a mosque in El Safya neighborhood of Bahri were killed by shelling.
</p><p>Fighting on 8 June broke out west of Bashair Teaching Hospital, one of the last few operational hospitals in the Khartoum area. The doctors at the hospital reported 150 wounded people admitted within the past 72 hours. Clashes also continued around the Yarmouk factory.
</p><p>By 8 June, over a thousand people had been killed in the battle of Khartoum, with the number impossible to count due to the sheer number of bodies and inability to access them. Civilians took matters into their own hands, burying bodies whenever possible. While some of the bodies have been documented, many are in unmarked graves in city streets, the floors of houses, and backyards.
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading4"><h4 id="9_June_ceasefire">9 June ceasefire</h4></div>
<p>The SAF and RSF held a 24-hour ceasefire on 9 June after continued mediation with the US and Saudi Arabia in Jeddah. There were no reported clashes that day. Civilians used this time to stock up on food and other supplies, although those who had lost homes to the raids and occupations by the RSF expressed disappointment that they were unable to enter their homes. The ceasefire failed by 10 June, when clashes broke out in the Haj Youssef area of Bahri. Shelling and fighting also occurred in southern and central Khartoum, along with the area around Shambat Bridge, as soon as the ceasefire expired at 06:00. By that time, six out of the 88 hospitals in the Khartoum area were operational. As many as 2,800 civilians fled to Wad Madani during the ceasefire. The Sudanese Red Crescent society suspended operations in Khartoum following the end of the ceasefire on 10 June.

Later that day, a ceasefire resulting from the renewed talks in Jeddah was implemented, with a span of three days. The following day, 18 June, was relatively calm in the three cities. Analysts warned that the ceasefire would be beneficial for helping the RSF regroup and mobilize. Despite this, normal life continued in the streets of Khartoum, a change welcomed by several Sudanese political parties such as the Sudanese Congress Party (NCP) and <a href="/wiki/National_Umma_Party" title="National Umma Party">National Umma Party</a> (NUP). <a href="/wiki/Malik_Agar" title="Malik Agar">Malik Agar</a>, the vice-president of the Sudanese transitional council, warned of the imminent failure of the ceasefire.
</p><p>The second day of the ceasefire also continued without incident. Homes occupied by the RSF were not vacated by the fighters, so some civilians were left homeless or forced to shelter with others. The RSF also accused the SAF of firing on an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ICRC" title="ICRC">ICRC</a> convoy carrying wounded soldiers. The SAF responded with timestamps of the convoy's movements, and alleged RSF snipers on Kober Bridge attacked the ICRC instead. Meanwhile, the residence of the Tunisian ambassador to Sudan was raided by alleged RSF militants.

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Expiry_of_the_ceasefire">Expiry of the ceasefire</h3></div>
<p>The ceasefire expired on 21 June, with fighting erupting shortly before the deadline, and intensifying just 30 minutes afterward. The Fetihab, Um Badda al-Mansura, al-Doha, and Abbasia neighborhoods saw the most conflict in Omdurman. The RSF also launched attacks on the SAF-controlled Corps of Engineers, but with little success. The SAF also launched air raids in Mayo neighborhood of Khartoum, and <a href="/wiki/Khartoum_Stadium" title="Khartoum Stadium">Khartoum Stadium</a>. The General Intelligence building caught on fire and was destroyed in the renewed fighting. The SAF also heavily shelled the Yarmouk area, which was still under RSF control. A statement released by the SAF alleged that the Central Reserve Police conducted a successful counterattack against the RSF in Khartoum and Omdurman.
</p><p>Fighting continued into 22 June, with the clashes in Omdurman expanding to old Omdurman and western Omdurman. The northern neighborhoods of Omdurman, which saw the most conflict immediately post-ceasefire, were still contested as the SAF launched a counteroffensive against RSF sites in those areas of the city. The RSF claimed that it had downed a Sudanese <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MiG-29" title="MiG-29">MiG</a> fighter, and that the SAF shelling of Omdurman the day before had killed three families along with worshippers in a mosque. Videos also emerged of the SAF's 9th Airborne Division participating in the offensive, along with the SAF still in control of the medical area north of the General Command despite recent RSF attacks. Hospitals in the Khartoum area, which had been able to finally receive aid during the ceasefire, were once again running low by 23 June.

<p>The RSF claimed the capture of the Central Reserve Police force headquarters on 25 June. The group later released videos of captured ammo boxes, and claimed the capture of dozens of vehicles and tanks. The SAF denied these claims, stating that the RSF attacks failed, although on 26 June they acknowledged the RSF's capture of the base. At least 14 civilians were killed in the fighting since the ceasefire, and 217 more were injured. The fall of the base cut off SAF supply lines to the SAF base in El Shajara, along with the capture of the de facto headquarters of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Interior_Minister_of_Sudan" title="Interior Minister of Sudan">Interior Minister of Sudan</a> and chief of police since 15 April.

</p><p>On 1 July, RSF fighters killed a medical worker at a hospital in Aldroshab, Khartoum North. The attack was a retaliation by Janjaweed and the RSF after a wounded commander they brought into the hospital died of his injuries. That same day, the SAF captured the al-Wasatia junction south of the Armored Corps, indicating a slight expansion of territory. At the end of the ceasefire, the RSF had been geolocated to be in control of several areas of Khartoum. The most notable locations were <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Manshia_Bridge&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Manshia Bridge (page does not exist)">Manshia Bridge</a>, the El Shajara gas deposits and refining facilities, the <a href="/wiki/Republican_Palace,_Khartoum" title="Republican Palace, Khartoum">Republican Palace</a>, and a presence in front of the SAF-controlled General Intelligence headquarters.

<p>The ceasefire expired on 2 July, leading to a massive RSF assault on an SAF base. In the attack, the RSF claimed the capture of five SAF soldiers. The RSF also began besieging the Alia Military Hospital, which was where <a href="/wiki/Omar_al-Bashir" title="Omar al-Bashir">Omar al-Bashir</a> and other former NCP officials were believed to be located.

The RSF and its ally Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) were, at the time (after 20 May 2025), present in only the 5 Darfur and the 3 Kordofan states (with the exception of limited pockets held by the SPLM-N and the RSF in the Blue Nile State), with the SAF (and allies) fully in control of the other 10 of Sudan's 18 states (with the Blue Nile State exception as before mentioned).

The RSF established makeshift detention centres in and around Khartoum, where civilians, mostly young men, were detained, tortured, and in many cases, executed. Also, multiple human rights organisations, including Amnesty International, have documented cases where women and girls were raped, gang-raped, and held in sexual slavery by RSF fighters.</div></div>
