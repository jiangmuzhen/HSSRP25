<p>According to the website of the Spanish electrical operator <a href="/wiki/Red_El%C3%A9ctrica_de_Espa%C3%B1a" title="Red Eléctrica de España">Red Eléctrica de España</a> (REE) that documents the power grid, there was sufficient power supplied to the grid leading up to the outage. At 12:30 on 28 April, the grid was supplied with 32 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gigawatts" title="Gigawatts">gigawatts</a> (GW) of power to meet 25 GW of demand, and was exporting 2.6 GW to Portugal, 0.87 GW to France and 0.78 GW to Morocco. The remainder was used for hydropumping (3 GW). More than half of the power supply was from solar, and <a href="/wiki/Negative_pricing#Electricity" title="Negative pricing">electricity price was slightly negative</a>.

<p>In Portugal, the blackout made most basic services inoperational, including stores, supermarkets, pharmacies and electronic payment systems. Hospitals resorted to generators to maintain operations. Traffic lights and transit systems were brought to a halt, causing road accidents. Additional police officers were deployed to deal with traffic problems caused by the failure of traffic lights. Mobile networks also experienced severe limitations, particularly voice calls and data services.
</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Commuter_rail" title="Commuter rail">commuter rail</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rapid_transit" title="Rapid transit">rapid transit</a> services were stopped due to <a href="/wiki/Railway_signal" title="Railway signal">signaling</a> problems, and trains were evacuated. Nonetheless, rail transport wasn't particularly affected since <a href="/wiki/Comboios_de_Portugal" title="Comboios de Portugal">Comboios de Portugal</a> were on strike that day. Electric buses, boats, ridesharing bicycles and trams were unable to depart their stations. <a href="/wiki/Lisbon_Airport" title="Lisbon Airport">Lisbon Airport</a> operated with limitations and closed at around 13:00 WEST (14:00 CEST), although flights were allowed to take off from around 21:38 WEST. Meanwhile, airports in <a href="/wiki/Porto_Airport" title="Porto Airport">Porto</a> and <a href="/wiki/Faro_Airport" title="Faro Airport">Faro</a> switched to generator power.
</p><p>During the blackout, there was a scramble to stock up on essential items such as food and water, as well as batteries, lighting devices, and radios. The state-owned water company <a href="/wiki/%C3%81guas_de_Portugal" title="Águas de Portugal">Águas de Portugal</a> asked consumers to moderate their water usage to prevent system failures during the power cut. Even after the blackout, certain services such as the Portuguese Tax Portal remained offline until service could be restored on Wednesday.
</p><p>The cabinet of Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Lu%C3%ADs_Montenegro" title="Luís Montenegro">Luís Montenegro</a> held an emergency meeting over the power cut, and declared an energy crisis on 28<span class="nowrap"> </span>April. The Prime Minister planned to ask the European Union for an audit of the affected electrical systems. He also took the decision to keep <i>Tapada do Outeiro</i> <a href="/wiki/Black_start" title="Black start">black start</a> capability available until at least 2030 and expand that capability to at least two more locations, <a href="/wiki/Alqueva_Dam" title="Alqueva Dam">Alqueva Dam</a> and <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Baixo_Sabor_Dam&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Baixo Sabor Dam (page does not exist)">Baixo Sabor Dam</a>, so that the recovery from a full blackout would be quicker.
</p><p>At least one person died as a result of the blackout in Portugal. The 77-year-old victim was connected to a mechanical ventilator at home 24 hours a day.

The international power lines from France first restarted the regions Aragón-Cataluña and Galicia-León, which then repowered the main grid. Hydropower and gas turbines increased the power. The international power lines from Morocco also contributed; to alleviate the power cut, Morocco delivered 900<span class="nowrap"> </span>MW of electricity through the <a href="/wiki/Spain-Morocco_interconnection" title="Spain-Morocco interconnection">Spain-Morocco interconnection</a> that crosses the <a href="/wiki/Strait_of_Gibraltar" title="Strait of Gibraltar">Strait of Gibraltar</a> from <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Fardioua&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Fardioua (page does not exist)">Fardioua</a> to <a href="/wiki/Tarifa" title="Tarifa">Tarifa</a>, while France sent up to 2 GW of electricity through power lines supplying <a href="/wiki/Catalonia" title="Catalonia">Catalonia</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Basque_Country_(autonomous_community)" title="Basque Country (autonomous community)">Basque Country</a>, and in turn Germany sent power to France. The supply reactivation after the “zero energy” in Spain was accomplished by Aldeadávila hydroelectric power plant in Salamanca, operated by Iberdrola. This hydroelectric power plant has an autonomous start, which differentiates it from most power plants that need energy to keep producing. Thus, it was possible to reactivate other power plants and substations gradually.   By evening, most of the Peninsula had power, and <a href="/wiki/Luis_Mar%C3%ADa_Atienza" title="Luis María Atienza">Luis Atienza</a> (former REE president and member of Spain's current ruling party) noted the relatively quick repowering of such a large area, in comparison to the days of <a href="/wiki/Rolling_blackout" title="Rolling blackout">rotating outages</a> during the <a href="/wiki/2021_Texas_power_crisis" title="2021 Texas power crisis">2021 Texas power crisis</a>. In the following days, gas turbines were delivering more power than usual, as their inertia and voltage stability was demanded by the grid operator, but increasing the cost by about 1 eurocent per kWh.
</p><p>By 07:00<span class="nowrap"> </span>CEST (05:00<span class="nowrap"> </span>UTC) on 29<span class="nowrap"> </span>April, electricity had been restored to 99% of energy demand, and full restoration was achieved by 11:00<span class="nowrap"> </span>CEST (09:00<span class="nowrap"> </span>UTC) that same day. Exports to France also resumed.
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Portugal_2">Portugal</h3></div>
<p>Electricity was gradually restored around 17:00<span class="nowrap"> </span>WEST (16:00<span class="nowrap"> </span>UTC) using the two systems that had <a href="/wiki/Black_start" title="Black start">black start</a> capabilities, the 138 MW <a href="/wiki/Castelo_do_Bode_Dam" title="Castelo do Bode Dam">Castelo do Bode</a> hydropower dam and the 990 MW natural gas power station Tapada do Outeiro. Around 22:30<span class="nowrap"> </span>WEST (21:30 UTC), power had been restored to half of the population, increasing to 80% by around 00:00<span class="nowrap"> </span>WEST (23:00<span class="nowrap"> </span>UTC). The grid was fully restored in Portugal by early 29<span class="nowrap"> </span>April.
</p><p>However, Portugal did not allow the resumption of electricity imports from Spain until 8 May, setting a limit of 1 GW to the transmission capacity until 12 May.
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Possible_causes">Possible causes</h2></div>
<p>The causes of the power outage are under investigation. The blackout was purportedly due to two fluctuations in the electrical grid, the second of which caused Spain's power system to disconnect from the European system and collapse the Iberian electricity network.
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Inter-area_oscillations">Inter-area oscillations</h3></div>
<p>In the 30<span class="nowrap"> </span>minutes before the blackout at 12:33:18<span class="nowrap"> </span>CEST, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Grid_oscillations" title="Grid oscillations">low-frequency oscillations</a> of the frequency were measured (with <a href="/wiki/Phasor_measurement_unit" title="Phasor measurement unit">phasor measurement units</a>) and damped out. The 0,2 Hz oscillations appear to have been between the Iberian Peninsula and the rest of the European wide grid, as they were in opposite <a href="/wiki/Phase_(waves)" title="Phase (waves)">grid phase</a>. Two inter-area oscillations appeared from 12:03:15 to 12:07:40 and from 12:19:01 to 12:22:03. The disconnection from the Central European system occurred at 12:33:19 CEST right after the Spanish system lagged more than 90°, causing instability on the transmission lines.
</p><p>There were also low frequency voltage oscillations and, after the blackout started, continued frequency oscillations were detected. Along with these, systems could have disconnected due to fast <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/RoCoF" title="RoCoF">RoCoF</a> (rate of change of frequency) above 1.5 Hz/s, which can be stressful on spinning turbines.
</p><p>Similar oscillations and disconnection happened in December<span class="nowrap"> </span>2016 and July<span class="nowrap"> </span>2021, though with less severe adverse effects. Then, the North-South "ambient" frequency was 0.25<span class="nowrap"> </span>Hz, while now it appears to be lower at 0.217<span class="nowrap"> </span>Hz, likely due to the recent addition of the <a href="/wiki/Baltic_states" title="Baltic states">Baltic states</a> and Ukraine to the <a href="/wiki/Continental_Europe_Synchronous_Area" title="Continental Europe Synchronous Area">Continental Europe Synchronous Area</a> (CESA).
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Variable_renewable_energy">Variable renewable energy</h3></div>
<p>The exact cause of the blackout remains under investigation, but it has prompted discussion about the stability of electricity systems with high shares of variable <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a>. Early analysis suggests the blackout is unlikely to have been caused by Spain's high share of renewable energy; however, it has highlighted the need for continued investment in power grid stability and resilience as Spain and other countries transition toward higher shares of renewable energy.
</p><p>At the time of the incident, <a href="/wiki/Solar_energy" title="Solar energy">solar energy</a> accounted for approximately 59% of Spain's electricity supply, with wind providing around 12%, nuclear 11%, and gas 5%, according to <i><a href="/wiki/The_Independent" title="The Independent">The Independent</a></i>. The initial fault is believed to have originated in <a href="/wiki/Extremadura" title="Extremadura">Extremadura</a>, a region that hosts a large proportion of Spain's <a href="/wiki/Photovoltaic_power_station" title="Photovoltaic power station">solar farms</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hydroelectricity" title="Hydroelectricity">hydroelectric</a> facilities, and the 2 GW <a href="/wiki/Almaraz_Nuclear_Power_Plant" title="Almaraz Nuclear Power Plant">Almaraz Nuclear Power Plant</a>, Spain's most powerful <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant" title="Nuclear power plant">nuclear power plant</a>.
</p><p>Some political groups, including the Spanish far-right <a href="/wiki/Vox_(political_party)" title="Vox (political party)">Vox party</a>, attributed the blackout to over-reliance on renewables and called for a more diversified <a href="/wiki/Energy_mix" title="Energy mix">energy mix</a>. An energy analyst at <a href="/wiki/Rystad_Energy" title="Rystad Energy">Rystad Energy</a>, Pratheeksha Ramdas, said that greater amounts of renewables in the power system may have made the grid susceptible to outages, but that there are multiple possible causes of the disturbance. Henning Gloystein, director for energy at the <a href="/wiki/Eurasia_Group" title="Eurasia Group">Eurasia Group</a> research firm, claimed it might have been easier to keep the system functioning if conventional energy sources like oil and gas had a larger presence.
</p><p>However, several officials and energy experts have rejected the idea that renewables are to blame. EU energy commissioner, <a href="/wiki/Dan_J%C3%B8rgensen" title="Dan Jørgensen">Dan Jørgensen</a>, stated that there was "nothing unusual" about the electricity mix at the time of the blackout, and that the outage was not due to a "specific source energy". Daniel Muir, a European power analyst at <a href="/wiki/S%26P_Global" title="S&amp;P Global">S&amp;P Global</a>, said the nature and scale of the outage makes renewable energy an unlikely cause. Spain's Environment Minister, <a href="/wiki/Sara_Aagesen" title="Sara Aagesen">Sara Aagesen</a>, emphasised that the system had operated reliably under similar demand and energy mixes in the past, and <a href="/wiki/Beatriz_Corredor" title="Beatriz Corredor">Beatriz Corredor</a>, president of <a href="/wiki/Red_El%C3%A9ctrica_de_Espa%C3%B1a" title="Red Eléctrica de España">Red Eléctrica</a> and member of Spain's ruling party, said that it was inaccurate to attribute the blackout to Spain's growing use of renewable energy. At a press conference on 29 April, Sánchez dismissed allegations that renewable energy caused the power cut, calling them "lies" and criticising those who blamed the blackout on Spain's reliance on wind and solar power.
</p><p>The incident has also drawn attention to the concept of mechanical <a href="/wiki/Inertial_response" title="Inertial response">inertia</a> in power systems, which refers to the stabilising effect of spinning turbines in hydropower and <a href="/wiki/Thermal_power_station" title="Thermal power station">thermal power stations</a> (the latter including fossil-fueled, nuclear and solar thermal). A major aspect of moving away from electricity systems based on coal, gas, or nuclear power is the reduction in inertia on the grid. Solar, which accounted for the majority of Spain's electricity at the time, uses <a href="/wiki/Inverter-based_resource#Grid-following_vs._grid-forming" title="Inverter-based resource">grid-following inverters</a> for 80% of the supply and provides little <a href="/wiki/Rotational_energy" title="Rotational energy">rotating mass</a> to the grid. Commentators such as Adam Bell, director of policy at strategy consultancy Stonehaven, argued that a lack of inertia due to renewable energy was not the "main driver for the blackout" as inertia was still present at the time of the blackout due to nuclear, hydroelectric, and grid-supporting technologies like <a href="/wiki/Synchronous_condenser" title="Synchronous condenser">synchronous condensers</a>. Bell said that solar, wind, and hydro remained operational after the event, while fossil fuel generation did not. An energy consultant also pointed to the small amount of controllable inertia, comparing the blackout to the <a href="/wiki/2016_South_Australian_blackout" title="2016 South Australian blackout">2016 South Australian blackout</a>, and suggesting the same solutions for Spain as Australia did; syncons and <a href="/wiki/Battery_energy_storage_system" title="Battery energy storage system">large batteries</a>. REE and Experts at Montel Analytics pointed to the <a href="/wiki/Continental_Europe_Synchronous_Area#List_of_electricity_interconnection_levels" title="Continental Europe Synchronous Area">relative isolation of the Iberian grid</a> as a contributing factor to the blackout, as neighbouring grids were less able to provide stability.

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Cyberattack">Cyberattack</h3></div>
<p>Spain's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_National_Cybersecurity_Institute_(INCIBE)" title="The National Cybersecurity Institute (INCIBE)">National Cybersecurity Institute</a> was reported to be investigating the possibility that a <a href="/wiki/Cyberattack" title="Cyberattack">cyberattack</a> caused the incident. Initial reports are mixed on the likelihood of the cause being a cyberattack, with several government officials ruling it out, and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal" title="The Wall Street Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a></i> claiming that "the outages bear hallmarks of a sophisticated cyberattack on the region's power grid" that fit a pattern of increased cyberattacks in Europe. A thorough forensic analysis was estimated to take one to three weeks.
</p><p>On the morning of 29<span class="nowrap"> </span>April, <a href="/wiki/Red_El%C3%A9ctrica_de_Espa%C3%B1a" title="Red Eléctrica de España">REE</a>  attributed the outage to a disconnection of the grid in the south-west of Spain. The institution ruled out a cyberattack as the cause of the blackout and announced that it was investigating the cause of the disconnection.

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Misinformation">Misinformation</h2></div>
<p>Several false and misleading claims were circulated regarding the origins of the power cut.
