<p>Public and student-led anti-government demonstrations are being held throughout several cities in Indonesia. They were launched on 17 February 2025 by the <a href="/wiki/All-Indonesian_Students%27_Union" title="All-Indonesian Students' Union">All-Indonesian Students' Union</a> (BEM SI), together with individual students' unions.
</p><p>According to the central coordinator of BEM SI, Herianto, the alliance had called for protests all over the country on 17 and 18 February (cancelled at Jakarta), while they would hold the protest centrally at Jakarta on 19 (cancelled) and 20 February. The Civil Society Coalition had also called for civilians to participate in demonstrations on 21 February following Friday prayers. BEM SI projected that around 5,000 students would participate in the protests, and they also threatened further actions if the government does not react positively.
</p><p>The second wave of protests began in March 2025 following the ratification of newly-revised <a href="/wiki/Indonesian_National_Armed_Forces_Law" title="Indonesian National Armed Forces Law">Indonesian National Armed Forces Law</a>, which increased the number of civilian positions that soldiers are allowed to hold, from 10 to 14. Generally, most of the protests were held in front of the building of respective legislatures (national or regional), with its participants usually having worn black clothing, marked by the <a href="/wiki/Tire_fire" title="Tire fire">burning of used tires</a> and clashes with policemen. Protests have peaked in February and March 2025, but they began to fade since then.

<p>The protests occurred as a response over controversial policies by Indonesian president <a href="/wiki/Prabowo_Subianto" title="Prabowo Subianto">Prabowo Subianto</a> and his vice-president <a href="/wiki/Gibran_Rakabuming_Raka" title="Gibran Rakabuming Raka">Gibran Rakabuming Raka</a>, which include the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Free_nutritious_meal&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Free nutritious meal (page does not exist)">free nutritious meal</a> (MBG) programme and the enactment of <a href="/wiki/Presidential_Instruction_Number_1_of_2025" title="Presidential Instruction Number 1 of 2025">Presidential Instruction Number 1 of 2025</a>, which led into massive budget cuts, supposedly to fund the free nutritious meal programme. The nickname <span title="Indonesian-language text"><i lang="id">#IndonesiaGelap</i></span> itself originates as a <a href="/wiki/Hashtag_activism" title="Hashtag activism">hashtag</a> popular on <a href="/wiki/Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> (X). According to <i>Beautynesia</i>, the hashtag had been used by more than 760 thousand tweets, but within 24 hours, this number has increased up to 14 million tweets. While according to coordinator of BEM SI, Satria Naufal, it represents "the fears, worries, and well-being of the citizens". Digital research company Jangkara found that during February 2025, the hashtag has received 81% negative sentiment, followed by 13% neutral and 6% positive, based on their analysis on 64,816 comments on X.
</p><p>The student protests were preceded by a similar anti-government <span title="Indonesian-language text"><i lang="id">Adili Jokowi</i></span> ('<a href="/wiki/Trial" title="Trial">Try</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jokowi" title="Jokowi">Jokowi</a>') protest, which occurred at <a href="/wiki/Surakarta" title="Surakarta">Surakarta</a> on 14 February 2025, demanding investigation of cases involving him. However, 10 minutes later, the protesters dispersed after heavy rain. Alongside this, there have been instances of <a href="/wiki/Graffiti" title="Graffiti">graffiti</a> bearing the inscription <span title="Indonesian-language text"><i lang="id">Adili Jokowi</i></span> throughout parts of Java, such as <a href="/wiki/Yogyakarta" title="Yogyakarta">Yogyakarta</a>, <a href="/wiki/Surabaya" title="Surabaya">Surabaya</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Malang" title="Malang">Malang</a>, much of which was later removed by local authorities. Musician <a href="/wiki/Iwan_Fals" title="Iwan Fals">Iwan Fals</a>, nonetheless, has criticised this demand and questioned what are his faults in office. Meanwhile, founder of KedaiKOPI, Hendri Satrio, has also doubted the success of this movement, stating that it would be difficult for the Prabowo's government to arrest and bring Jokowi into justice.
</p><p>Central coordinator of BEM SI, Herianto, claimed that Indonesia "is being led by twin suns", and gave an example regarding ban on sale of 3 kg <a href="/wiki/Liquefied_petroleum_gas" title="Liquefied petroleum gas">LPG</a> <a href="/wiki/Gas_cylinder" title="Gas cylinder">gas cylinders</a> by <a href="/wiki/Warung" title="Warung">small informal retail traders</a>, a policy that was enforced without knowledge of the president Prabowo Subianto and then subsequently repealed. He also claimed that students were disappointed after Prabowo shouted "Long live Jokowi!" during the 17th anniversary of <a href="/wiki/Gerindra_Party" title="Gerindra Party">Gerindra Party</a> at <a href="/wiki/Sentul_International_Convention_Center" title="Sentul International Convention Center">Sentul International Convention Center</a>. Prabowo himself has been accused by his opponents and political analysts of being Jokowi's puppet due to his closeness and the former's president influence on his policies. Prabowo denied this accusation multiple times, the most recent being during the same 17th anniversary event of Gerindra Party, which he responded to by saying "<i>Ndasmu!</i>" ("Your head!") with a mocking tone and facial expression. Such reaction attracted criticism from the public as being childish and confrontational towards his opposition.
</p><p>Meanwhile, during protests on 17 February, Prabowo attended a closed meeting together with his ministers of <a href="/wiki/Red_and_White_Cabinet" title="Red and White Cabinet">Red and White Cabinet</a> at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Istana_Merdeka" title="Istana Merdeka">Istana Merdeka</a> while discussing various strategic issues such as prevention of <a href="/wiki/Online_gambling" title="Online gambling">online gambling</a>. They were also seen having lunch together. At the same time, all eight fractions of DPR agreed to officially ratify the proposed revision of Mineral and Coal Law in 13th plenary session on 18 February. One of the proposed change to the law was to allow universities and colleges across Indonesia to receive mining permits and become involved in mining. Proponents of this change from the government argued that this will lower cost of tertiary education, while academics and students criticized the change as potentially used to silence universities from participating in activism while worsening ecological damage caused by the mining industry. This proposed change was later dropped when the law was passed on 17 February by the parliament the same day the protests erupted.

<p>In March 2025, protests began to renew after <a href="/wiki/Indonesian_National_Armed_Forces_Law" title="Indonesian National Armed Forces Law">Indonesian National Armed Forces Law</a> underwent revision by the DPR. The important points of this version, include:
</p>
<ul><li>Chapter 3:
<ul><li>Armed Forces, previously subordinated to both the <a href="/wiki/President_of_Indonesia" title="President of Indonesia">President of Indonesia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Indonesia)" title="Ministry of Defense (Indonesia)">Ministry of Defense</a> (Kemhan), is now fully subordinated to Kemhan.</li></ul></li>
<li>Chapter 7:
<ul><li>Non-war military operations (OMSP) were increased from previous 14 into 16 tasks. The newly-added two tasks include protection efforts against cyberattacks, and protection of Indonesian citizens and national interests overseas.</li></ul></li>
<li>Chapter 47:
<ul><li>The number of civilian positions TNI members are allowed to occupy were increased from previous 10 into 14 positions. Five of them include <a href="/wiki/National_Agency_for_Disaster_Countermeasure" title="National Agency for Disaster Countermeasure">National Agency for Disaster Countermeasure</a> (BNPB), <a href="/wiki/National_Border_Management_Agency" title="National Border Management Agency">National Border Management Agency</a> (BNPP), <a href="/wiki/National_Counter_Terrorism_Agency" title="National Counter Terrorism Agency">National Counter Terrorism Agency</a> (BNPT), <a href="/wiki/Indonesian_Maritime_Security_Agency" title="Indonesian Maritime Security Agency">Maritime Security Agency</a> (Bakamla), and <a href="/wiki/Attorney_General%27s_Office_of_Indonesia" title="Attorney General's Office of Indonesia">Attorney General's Office</a> (Kejagung). The proposal to add <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Marine_Affairs_and_Fisheries" title="Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries">Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries</a> (KKP) into this list was shortly abandoned before its ratification.</li></ul></li>

<p>On 19 March, Commission I of DPR and the government agreed to ratify the law next day, and it officially took effect on 20 March during a plenary session. This law caused strong criticism from various parties because it would potentially revive <i><a href="/wiki/Dwifungsi" title="Dwifungsi">dwifungsi</a></i>, leading to an online petition calling for repeal of the revision on <a href="/wiki/Change.org" title="Change.org">Change.org</a> (as of 19 March, it has been signed by more than 26 thousand people). At the same time, the perception of TNI began to deteriorate following a <a href="/wiki/Police_raid" title="Police raid">police raid</a> on <a href="/wiki/Cockfighting#Indonesia" title="Cockfighting">cockfighting</a> gamble site incident at <a href="/wiki/Way_Kanan_Regency" title="Way Kanan Regency">Way Kanan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lampung" title="Lampung">Lampung</a>, which led into deaths of 3 policemen after being shot by 2 soldiers and a <a href="/wiki/Test_drive" title="Test drive">test-drive</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Car_theft" title="Car theft">car theft</a>, which killed a car salesman after being shot by a <a href="/wiki/Indonesian_Navy" title="Indonesian Navy">Navy</a> sailor at <a href="/wiki/North_Aceh_Regency" title="North Aceh Regency">North Aceh</a>, both were happened on March 17.

<p>A second wave of demonstrations against the Draft Law on the Indonesian National Army (RUU TNI) is currently taking place across multiple regions, including Yogyakarta and Jakarta, on 19–20 March 2025. The protests involved students, lecturers, and civil society organizations, who expressed concerns that the bill could undermine democratic principles and civilian supremacy over the military. In Yogyakarta, protesters from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/University_of_Gadjah_Mada" title="University of Gadjah Mada">University of Gadjah Mada</a> (UGM) and the <a href="/wiki/Islamic_University_of_Indonesia" title="Islamic University of Indonesia">Islamic University of Indonesia</a> (UII) presented several key demands:
</p>
<ol><li>Demand that the Government and DPR cancel the revision of the TNI Law, which lacks transparency, is rushed, and disregards public opinion, as it constitutes a constitutional violation.</li>
<li>Demand that the Government and DPR uphold the constitution and remain committed to the Reform Agenda by preserving the principles of civilian supremacy and equality before the law, while firmly rejecting the dual function of the TNI/Polri (<i><a href="/wiki/Dwifungsi" title="Dwifungsi">dwifungsi</a></i>).</li>
<li>Demand that the TNI/Polri, as state institutions, undergo internal reforms and enhance their professionalism to restore public trust.</li>
<li>Urge all academics across Indonesia to take a firm stance against actions that undermine democracy, violate the constitution, and deviate from the reform agenda.</li>

They presented four main demands, expressing concerns that the revisions could weaken civilian supremacy and potentially reintroduce the military's dual function (<i>dwifungsi</i> TNI) in politics and governance. The demands were presented to Minister of Law, <a href="/wiki/Supratman_Andi_Agtas" title="Supratman Andi Agtas">Supratman Andi Agtas</a>. The key demands of the protest included:
</p>
<ol><li>Reject the entire draft revision of the TNI Law which is considered to weaken civilian supremacy and open up opportunities for the return of the dual function of the TNI.</li>
<li>Urging the removal and termination of active TNI-Polri officers from civilian positions to prevent abuse of power and corrupt practices in the military.</li>
<li>Achieve civilian supremacy and stop the neglect of the reform agenda to ensure that the military remains in the corridor of its main task as the guardian of national defence.</li>

Dozens of students and activists demanded President Prabowo Subianto and Vice President <a href="/wiki/Gibran_Rakabuming_Raka" title="Gibran Rakabuming Raka">Gibran Rakabuming Raka</a> resign, while carrying posters criticising the government. The demonstration themed 'Ruwat Ruweting Penguasa Durno' was based on the concept of ruwatan in Javanese culture, which means cleansing from harm.

<p>The police asked the demonstrators in the yard of the DIY DPRD to disperse using loudspeakers. The demonstrators asked for permission to stay until morning, but the police only gave them one hour. Yogyakarta Police Chief Senior Commissioner Aditya Surya Dharma stated, "Please discuss it, we'll give you one hour." Meanwhile, representatives of the masses hoped that the demonstration could last all night with the concept of "camping together" to voice their opinions. However, the police stuck to their initial decision, limiting the time of the demonstration to 00.00 WIB. At around 00.40 WIB, the police deployed two Mobile Brigade (Brimob) tactical vehicles and dozens of riot police. Chaos ensued, with bottles and firecrackers being thrown at the police. Water cannons were used to push back the demonstrators. Meanwhile, outside the DIY DPRD complex, from the south side there was another group of people trying to approach the demonstrators rejecting the TNI Law. This unidentified group in civilian clothes uttered various insults at the demonstrators rejecting the TNI Law who they considered to be the cause of the riot. A number of police personnel were seen blocking the group of residents so that they would not clash with the protesters who remained in front of the DPRD building. The police prevented a clash between the two groups. The Secretary of the DIY DPRD, Yudi Ismono, said he could not yet detail the total losses due to vandalism.

Several state-owned enterprises such as <a href="/wiki/Pertamina" title="Pertamina">Pertamina</a> (which had found itself in an concurrent consumer boycott over allegations of adulterated fuel that surfaced during an corruption investigation) and three state-owned banks were also being targeted by the boycott movement.

<p>In March 2025, Indonesia's financial markets faced a severe jolt as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jakarta_Composite_Index" title="Jakarta Composite Index">Jakarta Composite Index</a> (JCI) plunged by over 7% in a single trading session. This sharp <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Intraday" title="Intraday">intraday</a> decline—recorded on 18 March—was the steepest since 2011. The plunge triggered an automatic 30-minute trading halt as markets faced a decline of 6.146% during closure at around 9:37 AM, a mechanism designed to stabilize markets at 5% during periods of excessive volatility. After a 30 minute halt, trading resumed but the index continued to decline, reaching a 7.1% drop at one point. The sharp decline in Indonesia’s stock market quickly rippled across other sectors, with technology and manufacturing companies posting the biggest losses. Shares of <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=DCI_Indonesia&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="DCI Indonesia (page does not exist)">DCI Indonesia</a>, a leading provider of data center infrastructure, plunged around 20 percent, falling to 115,800 <a href="/wiki/Indonesian_rupiah" title="Indonesian rupiah">rupiah</a> (approximately $7). Meanwhile, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Chandra_Asri_Pacific&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Chandra Asri Pacific (page does not exist)">Chandra Asri Pacific</a>, a major player in energy and chemicals, saw its stock price drop nearly 19 percent by the afternoon. During trading, foreign investors made a net sell of IDR 2.48 trillion, continuing the trend of outflows totalling IDR 29.41 trillion since the beginning of the year. Foreign ownership in the JCI also fell to 2.9%, the lowest since 2011, reflecting a decline in global interest in the Indonesian market. This contrasted with other Asian bourses that rallied.  The negative market sentiment was fuelled by concerns over national economic conditions. The sudden downturn reflected a deepening crisis of investor confidence, rooted not only in macroeconomic uncertainties but also in political anxieties and shifting fiscal policies under President Prabowo Subianto’s administration. In February alone, the state budget (APBN) recorded a deficit of IDR 31.2 trillion, while the <a href="/wiki/Consumer_confidence_index" title="Consumer confidence index">consumer confidence index</a> and <a href="/wiki/Average_propensity_to_save" title="Average propensity to save">savings ratio</a> fell, indicating weak purchasing power. Layoffs increased, with major factories such as <a href="/wiki/Yamaha_Motor_Company" title="Yamaha Motor Company">Yamaha</a> and PT <a class="extiw" href="https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanken_Indonesia" title="id:Sanken Indonesia">Sanken Indonesia</a> closing. Tax revenue also weakened, with Income Tax 21 falling 39.5% YoY and IPR declining by 0.5% signalling consumption pressure. Systemic risk looms over the capital market, given the potential impact on the financial sector.
</p><p>Although <a href="/wiki/Macroeconomics" title="Macroeconomics">macroeconomic</a> factors and controversial <a href="/wiki/Fiscal_policy" title="Fiscal policy">fiscal policies</a> of the Prabowo Subianto administration were the main culprits, public discourse and political debates also highlighted the revision of the TNI Law (RUU TNI) as a factor that worsened market sentiment. According to a <a href="/wiki/Tempo_(Indonesian_magazine)" title="Tempo (Indonesian magazine)">Tempo</a> report, economist from CELIOS, Nailul Huda, stated that the decline in the JCI has been occurring since 14 March, and the TNI bill is one of the triggers. He highlighted concerns that the military's expanded role in the civilian and economic spheres could lead to legal uncertainty, erode <a href="/wiki/Meritocracy" title="Meritocracy">meritocracy</a>, and cause investor fear. One example is the appointment of an active military officer as President Director of <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Perum_Bulog&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Perum Bulog (page does not exist)">Perum Bulog</a>, which fuelled perceptions of military intervention in the business sector. Deputy Chairman of Commission I of the House of Representatives <a href="/wiki/Budi_Djiwandono" title="Budi Djiwandono">Budi Djiwandono</a> immediately reassured and denied that the TNI Bill was the direct cause of the JCI crash, asserting that there are no articles in the revised draft that explicitly regulate the placement of active TNI officers in state-owned enterprises. On the other hand, economists such as <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Wijayanto_Samirin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Wijayanto Samirin (page does not exist)">Wijayanto Samirin</a> cited the revision of the TNI Law as one of the five factors that caused the market crash, citing public concerns over the potential return of ABRI's dual function. This view reflects the market's sensitivity to the issue of militarisation, even if only as a perception.
</p><p>The response from Indonesian authorities was swift but indicative of broader systemic stress. The <a href="/wiki/Financial_Services_Authority_(Indonesia)" title="Financial Services Authority (Indonesia)">Financial Services Authority</a> (OJK) introduced temporary measures allowing publicly listed firms to buy back shares without requiring prior shareholder approval—a move aimed at supporting valuations and signaling confidence. Concurrently, <a href="/wiki/Bank_Indonesia" title="Bank Indonesia">Bank Indonesia</a> intervened in the foreign exchange market to stabilize the rupiah, deploying a combination of rate tools and reserves. These interventions did moderate the pace of capital outflows but did little to resolve the underlying concerns surrounding fiscal direction and political stability.
