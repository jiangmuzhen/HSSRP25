<p>After dating for seven years, they married on December 1, 1991, aged 31 and 61, after which she stopped performing in concert. In Hackman's later life, he wrote and published three historical novels with anthropologist Daniel Lenihan; Arakawa assisted by typing up Hackman's handwritten notes, editing, and providing feedback. In the acknowledgments of the 2004 novel, <i>Justice for None</i>, the co-authors thanked her for intervening when their disagreements became heated. In 2001, Arakawa and her close friend Barbara Lenihan co-founded a linens and home furnishings store in Santa Fe named Pandora's, which she ran until her death. Arakawa and Hackman were also business partners in a local Asian restaurant called Jinja, where she had helped with the menu.

Their friend Tom Allin told <a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times"><i>The New York Times</i></a> that she was "very protective" of her husband.
