<p>On 26 April 2025, at approximately 12:00 <a href="/wiki/Iran_Standard_Time" title="Iran Standard Time">Iran Standard Time</a> (IRST), an increasingly intense fire that contained reddish-hued smoke led to a large explosion in the Sina container yard within the port. Fifteen firefighters and all the staff inside the administrative building were killed in the initial explosion. The blast originated from several containers and produced a large fire and a plume of black smoke visible for kilometers. The shockwave shattered windows and caused structural damage to buildings several kilometers away. At least one building collapsed due to the blast. The explosion was reportedly heard as far as <a href="/wiki/Qeshm_Island" title="Qeshm Island">Qeshm Island</a>, 26 kilometers (16 miles) south of Bandar Abbas, and was felt at a distance of 50 kilometres (31 mi) from the site.

<p>According to initial reports, at least 70 people were killed in the explosion while 1,210 others were injured, 138 of them seriously. The casualty figure was later revised by the judiciary to 57 fatalities and more than 1,000 injuries as body parts were counted as a whole body. <a href="/wiki/Maryam_Rajavi" title="Maryam Rajavi">Maryam Rajavi</a> of the <a href="/wiki/National_Council_of_Resistance_of_Iran" title="National Council of Resistance of Iran">National Council of Resistance of Iran</a> accused Iran of covering up the death toll and was several times higher than officially reported, saying closer to 250 people were killed and an estimated 1,500 others were injured. The Chinese consulate in Bandar Abbas said three Chinese nationals were among the injured. Emergency services, including the <a href="/wiki/Iranian_Red_Crescent_Society" title="Iranian Red Crescent Society">Iranian Red Crescent Society</a>, dispatched rapid response teams to the scene. Injured individuals were evacuated and transported to nearby medical facilities and as far as <a href="/wiki/Shiraz" title="Shiraz">Shiraz</a>. Firefighting efforts were undertaken to control and extinguish the blaze using helicopters to pour water onto the fire from above. Port operations were suspended temporarily to facilitate emergency response activities. Schools and offices in the area were ordered closed on 27 April, while the health ministry advised residents not to go outside "until further notice" and to use protective masks.

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Investigation">Investigation</h2></div>
<p>Authorities launched an investigation into the cause of the explosion. Preliminary assessments suggested that negligence in handling flammable materials may have contributed to the incident. The <a href="/wiki/National_Iranian_Oil_Refining_and_Distribution_Company" title="National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company">National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company</a> stated that the explosion was not related to its infrastructure, including <a href="/wiki/Refinery" title="Refinery">refineries</a>, fuel tanks, distribution complexes, or oil pipelines. A government spokeswoman, <a href="/wiki/Fatemeh_Mohajerani" title="Fatemeh Mohajerani">Fatemeh Mohajerani</a>, said: "containers were stored in a corner of the port that likely contained chemicals which exploded. But until the fire is extinguished, it's hard to ascertain the cause."
</p><p>One analyst compared the blast to the <a href="/wiki/2020_Beirut_explosion" title="2020 Beirut explosion">2020 Beirut explosion</a> stating that it is consistent with an ignition and explosion of <a href="/wiki/Sodium_perchlorate" title="Sodium perchlorate">sodium perchlorate</a> (used to make rocket fuel) or <a href="/wiki/Ammonium_nitrate" title="Ammonium nitrate">ammonium nitrate</a> (used as <a href="/wiki/Fertilizer" title="Fertilizer">fertilizer</a>). The explosion has also been linked to a shipment of <a href="/wiki/Ammonium_perchlorate" title="Ammonium perchlorate">ammonium perchlorate</a>, a strong <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxidizer" title="Oxidizer">oxidizer</a> used in rocket fuel. A named maritime risk consultancy firm believed the explosion was caused by improper handling of ammonium perchlorate. The port received a shipment of ammonium perchlorate in March from <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a> to replenish Iran's stock for producing missiles.
</p><p>Without naming specific chemicals, Iranian authorities stated on 27 April 2025 that the explosion was caused by "hazardous goods and chemical materials" stored in the port. A spokesperson for the Iranian defense ministry, <a href="/wiki/Reza_Talaei-Nik" title="Reza Talaei-Nik">Reza Talaei-Nik</a>, denied that missile fuel had been transported via the site, without providing a possible cause of the explosion.
</p><p>On 28 April 2025, Iran's Interior Minister, <a href="/wiki/Eskandar_Momeni" title="Eskandar Momeni">Eskandar Momeni</a>, announced that the explosion was caused by negligence and non-compliance with safety measures. He stated that some individuals have been identified and summoned in connection with the incident, highlighting shortcomings in adhering to safety precautions and passive defense protocols. Momeni emphasized that the hazardous materials involved should have been dispersed to prevent such a disaster.
</p><p>On May 4, two people, including a government official, were arrested by Iranian authorities in connection with the explosion.

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Economic_impact">Economic impact</h2></div>
<p>The Port of Shahid Rajaee is Iran's largest maritime hub, handling approximately 80 million tons of goods annually and accounting for 85–90% of the country's container traffic, as well as 55% of Iran's total trade. It is also the 44th largest port in the world based on its handling capacity. The explosion led to the suspension of all imports and exports through the port. This disruption halted a substantial portion of Iran's trade activities, impacting revenue streams and the supply chain for essential goods. Despite the magnitude of the explosion, Iran's oil infrastructure, including refineries and pipelines in the vicinity, remained operational. The port's closure may impede the export of oil and related products, which are critical for Iran's economy and foreign currency earnings.
</p><p>The head of the <a href="/wiki/Iran_Road_Maintenance_%26_Transportation_Organization" title="Iran Road Maintenance &amp; Transportation Organization">Iran Road Maintenance &amp; Transportation Organization</a> reported on 30 April 2025 that the activities of loading, unloading and announcing cargo in the port had returned to normal conditions.

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Reactions">Reactions</h2></div>
<p>Messages were sent by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, as well as China, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Russia, Turkey, and the United Nations.
</p><p>Iran's Supreme Leader <a href="/wiki/Ali_Khamenei" title="Ali Khamenei">Ali Khamenei</a> called for an investigation by security and judicial officials to identify negligence or deliberate actions leading to the disaster. He also offered condolences to the injured and thanked those who donated blood to victims.
