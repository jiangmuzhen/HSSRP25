<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Early_life">Early life</h2></div>
<p>Ovechkin was born on 17 September 1985 in <a href="/wiki/Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>, the son of <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> athletes. His mother, <a href="/wiki/Tatyana_Ovechkina" title="Tatyana Ovechkina">Tatyana Ovechkina</a>, is a two-time Olympic gold medalist (<a href="/wiki/1976_Summer_Olympics" title="1976 Summer Olympics">1976</a>, <a href="/wiki/1980_Summer_Olympics" title="1980 Summer Olympics">1980</a>) and world champion (1975) in basketball. His father, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Mikhail_Ovechkin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Mikhail Ovechkin (page does not exist)">Mikhail</a>, was a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Soccer" title="Soccer">soccer</a> player. His mother sensed her youngest son was destined for "sporting greatness". "From birth, it was obvious," she said. "In a child, it's clear immediately. He was very active and walking and curious." His favorite NHL team growing up was the <a href="/wiki/San_Jose_Sharks" title="San Jose Sharks">San Jose Sharks</a> and also was the first NHL jersey he received. He was two years old when he first picked up a hockey stick. Whenever a hockey game came on television, he would drop whatever he was doing, refusing to allow his parents to change the channel.
</p><p>In early childhood, he moved with his family to a tall high-rise building surrounded by a "crumbling neighborhood" on the outskirts of Moscow. There he attended public school #596, infamous for military discipline and a "tyrannical" principal, completing eight and a half grades before starting at <a href="/wiki/Dynamo_Moscow" title="Dynamo Moscow">Dynamo Moscow</a>'s sports school. While he saw his friends "getting high and getting dead," Ovechkin was attending daily training sessions morning and night. "You dive into sport with your head and arms and legs, and there's no time for anything else," he said of this early training.
</p><p>Whenever his parents were no longer able to get young Alex to hockey events, his elder brother Sergei stepped up, making sure his little brother got where he needed to go. When Ovechkin was 10, Sergei died of a blood clot following a car accident. Ovechkin had a youth hockey game the next day, which his parents insisted he play in. Ovechkin credits his elder brother Sergei for introducing him to, and encouraging him to pursue hockey. When he scores, Ovechkin will often kiss his glove and point to the sky in a salute to his brother.
</p><p>Ovechkin established his reputation within the Dynamo Moscow system by scoring 56 goals at the age of 11, surpassing the previous record held by <a href="/wiki/Pavel_Bure" title="Pavel Bure">Pavel Bure</a>, who had scored 53 goals. Meanwhile, Ovechkin dreamed of playing in the NHL, keeping the cards of star players stashed in his room, especially those of his idol, <a href="/wiki/Mario_Lemieux" title="Mario Lemieux">Mario Lemieux</a>. "It's the best hockey there is," Ovechkin would say of the NHL.

Making his professional debut in the 2001–02 season, he scored four points in 21 games. He would spend three seasons there prior to being drafted by the NHL, and he would rack up 36 goals and 32 assists in 152 career games.
</p><p>The following off-season, Ovechkin was <a href="/wiki/List_of_first_overall_NHL_draft_picks" title="List of first overall NHL draft picks">selected first overall</a> in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/2004_NHL_Entry_Draft" title="2004 NHL Entry Draft">2004 NHL Entry Draft</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Washington_Capitals" title="Washington Capitals">Washington Capitals</a>. He had been projected as the first overall pick for nearly two years and had earned comparisons to <a href="/wiki/Mario_Lemieux" title="Mario Lemieux">Mario Lemieux</a>. He was so highly regarded that the <a href="/wiki/Florida_Panthers" title="Florida Panthers">Florida Panthers</a> attempted to draft him in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/2003_NHL_Entry_Draft" title="2003 NHL Entry Draft">2003 NHL Entry Draft</a> in the ninth round, even though his birthday was two days after the cut-off (<a href="/wiki/September_15" title="September 15">15 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1985" title="1985">1985</a>). <a href="/wiki/Rick_Dudley" title="Rick Dudley">Rick Dudley</a>, the general manager of the Panthers, claimed the pick was legitimate, claiming that Ovechkin was old enough with <a href="/wiki/Leap_year" title="Leap year">leap years</a> taken into consideration.
</p><p>Due to the <a href="/wiki/2004%E2%80%9305_NHL_lockout" title="2004–05 NHL lockout">2004–05 NHL lockout</a>, Ovechkin remained with Dynamo for one more season. In the playoffs, he helped Dynamo win the RSL title.
</p><p>With the threat of the lockout canceling another NHL season, Ovechkin signed a contract with rival Russian team <a href="/wiki/Avangard_Omsk" title="Avangard Omsk">Avangard Omsk</a>. In order to maintain his eligibility for the NHL in the event that the lockout ended, the contract contained an out clause with a 20 July 2005 deadline. Although a new NHL <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Collective_bargaining_agreement" title="Collective bargaining agreement">collective bargaining agreement</a> (CBA) had not yet been reached between players and owners, Ovechkin decided to opt out and signed with the Capitals on <a href="/wiki/August_5" title="August 5">5 August</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" title="2005">2005</a>. The deal was a three-year, entry-level contract worth the rookie maximum of $984,200 per season with performance-based bonuses to inflate his annual salary to as much as $3.9 million.

<p>Ovechkin is widely considered a generational talent and the greatest goal scorer in NHL history. He overtook <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Gretzky" title="Wayne Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> in total career goals (894) in April 2025. Gretzky himself had stated he was cheering for Ovechkin to break his record, and when asked about it in April 2019, Gretzky stated he wanted to be the first one to shake Ovechkin's hand if he were to do so; Gretzky stuck true to his promise when Ovechkin surpassed his previous record on 6 April 2025, as Gretzky was in attendance at the game against the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Islanders" title="New York Islanders">New York Islanders</a> and went down to the ice level to congratulate Ovechkin.
</p><p>He is known for his deadly <a href="/wiki/One_timer" title="One timer">one-timer</a>, which he usually fires from the left faceoff circle, an area known as his "office". In August 2006, <a href="/wiki/New_York_Rangers" title="New York Rangers">New York Rangers</a> forward <a href="/wiki/Jarom%C3%ADr_J%C3%A1gr" title="Jaromír Jágr">Jaromír Jágr</a> expressed admiration for Ovechkin's goal scoring productivity by quoting "All his goals, they are not flukes. Most of the time, he beats guys one-on-one, then you get your highlight". In October 2014, teammate <a href="/wiki/Brooks_Orpik" title="Brooks Orpik">Brooks Orpik</a> said of his one-timer: "You know it's going there, and you still can't stop him." Ovechkin proves "the exception rather than the rule when it comes to success" on one-timers, which "can be very difficult to pull off," involving "taking a hard pass and timing a shot perfectly, when the puck may be rolling or on end, while also aiming at a small net, particularly from far distances." In October 2014, <a href="/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning" title="Tampa Bay Lightning">Tampa Bay Lightning</a> captain <a href="/wiki/Steven_Stamkos" title="Steven Stamkos">Steven Stamkos</a> said of Ovechkin’s playing style, "He’s a guy that not only uses his skill set, but his physicality, that’s what sets him apart. He’s willing to go to those areas and has one of the best shots in the league." In July 2015, <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings" title="Los Angeles Kings">Los Angeles Kings</a> goaltender <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Quick" title="Jonathan Quick">Jonathan Quick</a> quoted Ovechkin's powerful shooting skills by saying "Guys like Ovi shoot it so hard that it's almost like you're a batter in baseball. You see the blur of the puck coming at you in frames."
</p><p>Ovechkin's ability to shoot and hit heavily as a <a href="/wiki/Power_forward_(ice_hockey)" title="Power forward (ice hockey)">power forward</a> has been well documented. After clinching the hardest shot title at the <a href="/wiki/2018_National_Hockey_League_All-Star_Game" title="2018 National Hockey League All-Star Game">2018 National Hockey League All-Star Game</a> skills competition with a 98.8 mph first attempt, he became the only player in the 2018 All Star game to break the century mark, surpassing 100 mph on his second shot, stepping "up to plate and delivered a blistering 101.3 MPH blast." In April 2025, Capitals teammate <a href="/wiki/Tom_Wilson_(ice_hockey)" title="Tom Wilson (ice hockey)">Tom Wilson</a> exclaimed on Ovechkin's capabilities by saying: “He’s a machine. He’s out there creating energy for our team, scoring. ... That’s what a leader does. It’s one thing to be good all season long, but the guys that show up and hit and block shots and lead the team, that’s why he’s a legend.”
</p><p>Ovechkin has been awarded the <a href="/wiki/Hart_Memorial_Trophy" title="Hart Memorial Trophy">Hart Memorial Trophy</a> honoring the most valuable player in the league three times (2008, 2009, 2013) and was also a finalist for the award two other times (in 2010 and 2015). Ovechkin's most enduring nickname is "The Great 8".
</p><p>While Ovechkin has been well known for being a prolific goal-scorer with his powerful shooting skills, he has also been shown to be a proficient passer and setting up goals scored by teammates. On 25 January 2018, when Ovechkin recorded his 500th assist on a <a href="/wiki/Nicklas_B%C3%A4ckstr%C3%B6m" title="Nicklas Bäckström">Nicklas Bäckström</a> goal in a 4–2 win over the <a href="/wiki/Florida_Panthers" title="Florida Panthers">Florida Panthers</a>, then–Capitals head coach <a href="/wiki/Barry_Trotz" title="Barry Trotz">Barry Trotz</a> said after the game, "He's a legendary player. He's getting the points, the goals, the assists. Everybody thinks of Alex as a pure goal-scorer, which he is, and he's got to those numbers hundreds of games before other people have reached that number but you always tend to forget he's a pretty good playmaker as well." On 22 October 2018, in a game against the <a href="/wiki/Vancouver_Canucks" title="Vancouver Canucks">Vancouver Canucks</a>, after Vancouver had pulled their goalie, Ovechkin passed the puck to teammate <a href="/wiki/T._J._Oshie" title="T. J. Oshie">T. J. Oshie</a> rather than score the easy <a href="/wiki/Hat-trick" title="Hat-trick">hat-trick</a> for himself since he had scored twice earlier in the game. "[Oshie asked] 'Why did you pass me the puck?<span style="padding-right:.15em;">'</span>" Ovechkin said. "But he was so wide open and I try to give him pass. Save mine for next time." On 9 February 2025, after a 5–4 shootout loss to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Utah_Hockey_Club" title="Utah Hockey Club">Utah Hockey Club</a>, a game where Ovechkin was held goalless but recorded three assists, Capitals head coach <a href="/wiki/Spencer_Carbery" title="Spencer Carbery">Spencer Carbery</a> described Ovechkin's passing abilities by remarking "Everybody is so focused on his shot when he gets the puck, you’re always thinking shot, shot, shot. But he’s got that look-off pass too, the shot-pass, I call it".
</p><p>Ovechkin has also been recognized for showing opposing players respect and admiration for either returning to their team after overcoming hard obstacles off the ice or by their performance on the ice. For example, In a game against the <a href="/wiki/Montreal_Canadiens" title="Montreal Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a> on 19 November 2018, early in to the <a href="/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_NHL_season" title="2018–19 NHL season">2018–19 season</a>, Canadiens goaltender <a href="/wiki/Carey_Price" title="Carey Price">Carey Price</a> made a sprawling stop on Ovechkin’s signature left circle slapshot in the dying seconds of the third period with both teams tied 4–4 and once he covered up the puck he skated over to Price and applauded him for his effort in denying him a hat trick and the game winner. The Capitals would go on to defeat the Canadiens in OT 5–4 with former Canadien <a href="/wiki/Lars_Eller" title="Lars Eller">Lars Eller</a> scoring the winning goal for the Capitals but if Ovechkin had scored it would’ve been a regulation 5–4 win for the Capitals and a hat trick for Ovechkin himself since he already had two goals earlier in that same game. Also, in a game against the Montreal Canadiens on 16 April 2022, towards the end of the <a href="/wiki/2021%E2%80%9322_NHL_season" title="2021–22 NHL season">2021–22 season</a>, Ovechkin showed respect and admiration for Canadiens goaltender Price by giving him a fist bump from across their respective benches during a stoppage of play. The Canadiens game the previous day against the New York Islanders was Price’s first game back from a knee injury he sustained the previous summer in the <a href="/wiki/2021_Stanley_Cup_Finals" title="2021 Stanley Cup Finals">2021 Stanley Cup Finals</a> against the <a href="/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning" title="Tampa Bay Lightning">Tampa Bay Lightning</a>, where Price and the Canadiens lost the series in five games. Price had multiple setbacks in his recovery, which included a brief stint in the NHL Players' Assistance Program to get help with his mental health after coming forward about his struggles from <a href="/wiki/Alcoholism" title="Alcoholism">alcohol abuse</a>. When asked about this welcome back gesture in a post-game interview, Ovechkin responded by saying "Obviously, he's one of the best players in the league. He was in a tough situation. He's a warrior and good for him, his organization, his family and the game of hockey."
</p><p>The Capitals' morning skate ritually begins with Ovechkin "sprinting around the rink, a solo lap to the sound of sticks tapping from his teammates." Once he's made it all the way around, the rest of the team jumps onto the ice to join him. Ovechkin is known as a durable player, losing little time to injuries, illnesses, or suspensions. After being struck on the foot by a teammate's wrist shot during an 26 October 2006 practice in Vancouver, he "crumpled to the ice and had to be helped to the locker room." Exhibiting no ill effects in practice the next day, Ovechkin famously told reporters, "I'm okay; Russian machine never breaks."
</p><p>Late in the <a href="/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_NHL_season" title="2008–09 NHL season">2008–09 season</a>, Ovechkin garnered some criticism over his exuberant after-goal celebrations. On 28 February 2009, during a segment of <i><a href="/wiki/Hockey_Night_in_Canada" title="Hockey Night in Canada">Hockey Night in Canada</a>'</i>s Coach's Corner, Canadian hockey analyst <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Don_Cherry_(ice_hockey)" title="Don Cherry (ice hockey)">Don Cherry</a> likened Ovechkin's celebrations of jumping into the boards and his teammates to that of soccer players, concluding that this was not the Canadian way and advising Canadian kids to ignore Ovechkin's example. Then-Capitals head coach <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Boudreau" title="Bruce Boudreau">Bruce Boudreau</a> came to Ovechkin's defence, stating Cherry "doesn't know Alex like we know Alex", and Ovechkin himself stated that he "doesn't care" about Cherry. The next notable incident happened on 19 March 2009, in a game against the Tampa Bay Lightning. After scoring his 50th goal of the season, Ovechkin put his stick on the ice, pretending to warm his hands over it because it was "hot". The incident sparked an immediate response from then–Tampa Bay head coach <a href="/wiki/Rick_Tocchet" title="Rick Tocchet">Rick Tocchet</a>, who said that "[Ovechkin] went down a notch in my books." Boudreau had also stated that he would discuss the incident with Ovechkin, and then-teammate <a href="/wiki/Mike_Green_(ice_hockey,_born_1985)" title="Mike Green (ice hockey, born 1985)">Mike Green</a>, despite being the first to celebrate with Ovechkin afterwards, commented that he did not wish to join in the pre-meditated celebration. Ovechkin himself was unapologetic, and said about Don Cherry in particular, "He's going to be pissed off for sure...I love it!".
</p><p>After using and endorsing <a href="/wiki/CCM_(ice_hockey)" title="CCM (ice hockey)">CCM</a> equipment for most of his career, Ovechkin made the move to <a href="/wiki/Bauer_Hockey" title="Bauer Hockey">Bauer Hockey</a> in August 2011 following a decline in his point production in the <a href="/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_Washington_Capitals_season" title="2010–11 Washington Capitals season">2010–11 season</a>. He continued to use Bauer equipment until the Stanley Cup-winning <a href="/wiki/2017%E2%80%9318_NHL_season" title="2017–18 NHL season">2017–18</a> season, when he switched back to CCM. Beginning in the 2023–24 season, Ovechkin began using a custom-manufactured-and-branded stick, featuring his own "8" logo.

According to some experts and people close to Ovechkin, renouncing Putin and <a href="/wiki/Russian_2022_war_censorship_laws" title="Russian 2022 war censorship laws">condemning the invasion of Ukraine</a> could have negative consequences for Ovechkin and his family members living in Russia, given the <a href="/wiki/Human_rights_in_Russia" title="Human rights in Russia">repressive nature</a> of <a href="/wiki/Russia_under_Vladimir_Putin" title="Russia under Vladimir Putin">Putin's regime</a>. Ovechkin reportedly wanted to change his Instagram profile picture from Putin to a <a href="/wiki/Peace_symbols" title="Peace symbols">peace symbol</a> after the invasion but was warned that doing so would potentially put his family in Russia in danger.

<p>Ovechkin was involved in a feud with <a href="/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins" title="Pittsburgh Penguins">Pittsburgh Penguins</a> forward <a href="/wiki/Evgeni_Malkin" title="Evgeni Malkin">Evgeni Malkin</a>, who was drafted second behind Ovechkin in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/2004_NHL_Entry_Draft" title="2004 NHL Entry Draft">2004 NHL Entry Draft</a>. Though the two were reported to be good friends when they roomed together during the <a href="/wiki/2006_Winter_Olympics" title="2006 Winter Olympics">2006 Winter Olympics</a> in <a href="/wiki/Turin" title="Turin">Turin</a>, Italy, this friendship quickly saw tension arise. The feud may have started in August 2007 when Ovechkin punched Malkin's Russian agent, Gennady Ushakov, at a Moscow nightclub. Ovechkin denied that version of events, while Malkin confirmed it. On 21 January 2008, in Pittsburgh, Ovechkin took a run at Malkin, which would have seemingly resulted in a devastating hit had Malkin not ducked out of the way just in time. The two would also not make eye contact at the 2008 NHL Awards Ceremony. Ovechkin has repeatedly denied "having it out" for Malkin. In 2009, in an interview with RT, Ovechkin would confirm that the event in which he punched Malkin's agent was true, while also stating "but is okay".
</p><p>The feud raised many concerns as to its effect on the league, and the Russian national team at the <a href="/wiki/2010_Winter_Olympics" title="2010 Winter Olympics">2010 Winter Olympics</a> in <a href="/wiki/Vancouver" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>. On 24 January 2009, at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/NHL_All-Star_Game_SuperSkills_Competition" title="NHL All-Star Game SuperSkills Competition">SuperSkills Competition</a>, Malkin assisted Ovechkin in his stunt during the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/NHL_All-Star_Game_SuperSkills_Competition#Breakaway_Challenge" title="NHL All-Star Game SuperSkills Competition">Breakaway Challenge</a>. Malkin handed Ovechkin his props for the stunt as well as handing him his stick and pouring some sports drink down Ovechkin's throat. It has been reported that <a href="/wiki/Ilya_Kovalchuk" title="Ilya Kovalchuk">Ilya Kovalchuk</a>, who was then the <a href="/wiki/Atlanta_Thrashers" title="Atlanta Thrashers">Atlanta Thrashers</a>' captain and a teammate of Ovechkin and Malkin on the Russian national team, brokered the peace between the two.
</p><p>Malkin gave a speech at Ovechkin's 35th birthday party in September 2020. The two are reportedly very close friends again, with the feud long in the past.

<p>In 2006 at a preseason charity golf tournament in <a href="/wiki/Springfield,_Virginia" title="Springfield, Virginia">Springfield, Virginia</a>, while playing golf for his first time, Ovechkin made a <a href="/wiki/Hole_in_one" title="Hole in one">hole in one</a> on a <a href="/wiki/Golf#Par" title="Golf">par 3 hole</a>.
</p><p>Ovechkin was formerly engaged to <a href="/wiki/Tennis" title="Tennis">tennis</a> player <a href="/wiki/Maria_Kirilenko" title="Maria Kirilenko">Maria Kirilenko</a>. On 21 July 2014, Kirilenko announced that the wedding was called off and that the two were no longer seeing each other. On 11 September 2015, Ovechkin announced his engagement to Nastya Shubskaya, the daughter of Russian actress <a href="/wiki/Vera_Glagoleva" title="Vera Glagoleva">Vera Glagoleva</a>, whom he subsequently married.
</p><p>Ovechkin and his wife have two children. In August 2018, the couple had a son, whom they named after Ovechkin's late brother. In May 2020, the couple had a second son.
