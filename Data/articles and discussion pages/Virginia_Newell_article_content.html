<p>Virginia Kimbrough was born on October 7, 1917, in <a href="/wiki/Advance,_North_Carolina" title="Advance, North Carolina">Advance, North Carolina</a>, one of nine children. Although her family was <a href="/wiki/African_Americans" title="African Americans">African American</a>, she grew up playing with the white children in a white neighborhood. Her father, a builder, also had the right to vote despite it being the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jim_Crow_era" title="Jim Crow era">Jim Crow era</a> because he had a white ancestor. Both of her parents had studied at <a href="/wiki/Shaw_University" title="Shaw University">Shaw University</a> without finishing a degree. Kimbrough learned arithmetic helping her father in his measurements, and won a mathematics competition in elementary school.
</p><p>Her family sent her away to live with a great aunt, so that she could obtain a better education at North Carolina's <a href="/wiki/Atkins_High_School_(North_Carolina)" title="Atkins High School (North Carolina)">Atkins High School</a>. There, she learned mathematics from teachers Togo West and Beatrice Armstead, earning straight A's and becoming a teacher's assistant. After graduating in 1936, she obtained scholarships from many colleges, and chose to major in mathematics at <a href="/wiki/Talladega_College" title="Talladega College">Talladega College</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Historically_black_colleges_and_universities" title="Historically black colleges and universities">historically black college</a> in Alabama. Many of her teachers there had previously taught at Ivy League universities, and had come to Talladega to teach because of <a href="/wiki/Mandatory_retirement" title="Mandatory retirement">mandatory retirement</a> at their former employers.
</p><p>She later earned a master's degree from <a href="/wiki/New_York_University" title="New York University">New York University</a>, and took courses from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin" title="University of Wisconsin">University of Wisconsin</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atlanta_University" title="Atlanta University">Atlanta University</a>, <a href="/wiki/University_of_Chicago" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/North_Carolina_State_College" title="North Carolina State College">North Carolina State College</a>. She completed a doctorate in education at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/University_of_Sarasota" title="University of Sarasota">University of Sarasota</a> in 1976, with the dissertation <i>Development of mathematics self-instructional learning packages with activities from the newspaper for prospective elementary school teachers enrolled at Winston-Salem State University</i>.

<p>Kimbrough post-college returned to Atkins High School as a mathematics teacher. There, in 1943, she married George Newell, who had been her biology teacher at the same school, changing her name to Virginia Newell. They had two daughters together: Glenda and Virginia, who are both physicians. Newell and her husband both taught at several institutions in <a href="/wiki/Atlanta" title="Atlanta">Atlanta</a> and <a href="/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina" title="Raleigh, North Carolina">Raleigh, North Carolina</a>, including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Washington_Graded_and_High_School" title="Washington Graded and High School">Washington Graded and High School</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/John_W._Ligon_High_School" title="John W. Ligon High School">John W. Ligon High School</a>, and Shaw University, where Virginia Newell was an associate professor of mathematics from 1960 to 1965. George Newell passed away in 1989.
</p><p>In 1965, they both settled at Winston-Salem State University, where Virginia Newell became a mathematics professor. At Winston-Salem State University, she chaired the mathematics department, helped bring computers to the university and founded the computer science program, becoming founding chair of the computer science department in 1979. She spearheaded several initiatives for middle school students, including the Math and Science Academy of Excellence, the New Directions for our Youth program aimed at preventing dropouts, and the Best Choice Center for after-school education. She was a co-founder and president of the North Carolina Council of Teachers on Mathematics.
</p><p>In 1980, Newell became one of the coauthors of <i><a href="/wiki/Black_Mathematicians_and_Their_Works" title="Black Mathematicians and Their Works">Black Mathematicians and Their Works</a></i> (with <a href="/wiki/Joella_Gipson" title="Joella Gipson">Joella Gipson</a>, L. Waldo Rich, and Beauregard Stubblefield, Dorrance &amp; Company), the first book to highlight the contributions of African American mathematicians. She was also editor of the newsletter of the <a href="/wiki/National_Association_of_Mathematicians" title="National Association of Mathematicians">National Association of Mathematicians</a>, an organization for African American mathematicians, from 1974 into the 1980s.
</p><p>She retired after 20 years of service at Winston-Salem State, <abbr title="circa">c.</abbr><span style="white-space:nowrap;"> 1985</span>, as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Professor_emerita" title="Professor emerita">professor emerita</a>.

<p>Newell first became politically active during the <a href="/wiki/Civil_rights_movement" title="Civil rights movement">civil rights movement</a> in the 1960s, spreading awareness both on the Shaw University campus where she was teaching at as well as in the greater community. She also participated in numerous protest marches held in support of the movement.
</p><p>As part of the <a href="/wiki/1972_United_States_presidential_election" title="1972 United States presidential election">1972 US presidential campaign</a>, Newell was co-chair of the <a href="/wiki/Shirley_Chisholm" title="Shirley Chisholm">Shirley Chisholm</a> campaign in North Carolina. In 1977, Newell was elected (with Vivian Burke) as one of the first two African American women to become aldermen of Winston-Salem, North Carolina; she represented its East Ward.
