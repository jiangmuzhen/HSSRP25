<div class="mw-heading mw-heading4"><h4 id="Main_themes_of_the_summit">Main themes of the summit</h4></div>
<p>The UNCBD COP16 mainly aimed to review progress of the countries towards the goals set by the <a href="/wiki/Kunming-Montreal_Global_Biodiversity_Framework" title="Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework">Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework</a> (GBF), which had been approved in December 2022, having set 23 general targets to "halt and reverse <a href="/wiki/Biodiversity_loss" title="Biodiversity loss">biodiversity loss</a>" by 2030.
</p><p>In the lead-up to the summit, national governments were expected to present their respective long-term strategies to meet the targets, known as National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs); however, a joint investigation by <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Carbon_Brief" title="Carbon Brief">Carbon Brief</a></i> revealed that only 25 of the 195 countries that had adhered to the Kunming-Montreal Framework had submit their NBSAPs before the start of the COP16. According to the inquiry, only five of the 17 <a href="/wiki/Megadiverse_countries" title="Megadiverse countries">megadiverse countries</a> (<a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a>, <a href="/wiki/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Malaysia" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>), as well as four <a href="/wiki/G7" title="G7">G7</a> nations (<a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>, <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>), submitted their respective NBSAPs by the deadline. Representatives for Colombia announced that the country would present its own plan during the meeting, while spokespersons for the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> and <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a> stated that the nations would not publish their respective NBSAPs earlier than 2025.
</p><p>The COP16 was also considered as an occasion to review other goals set at the <a href="/wiki/2022_United_Nations_Biodiversity_Conference" title="2022 United Nations Biodiversity Conference">previous conference</a> in <a href="/wiki/Montreal" title="Montreal">Montreal</a>, including an agreement to provide developing countries with at least <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" title="United States dollar">US$</a>20 billion to finance the implementation of conservation targets by 2025, and at least $30 billion a year by 2030. Another target included in the Global Biodiversity Framework urged countries to identify funding to <a href="/wiki/Pollution#Environment" title="Pollution">nature-damaging sources</a> and cut them by $500 billion a year by the end of the decade. Upon the start of the meeting, only seven developed countries had contributed to the Global Biodiversity Framework Fund (GBFF), donating a total of $244 million.
</p><p>Moreover, participating countries were expected to negotiate the first global agreement on <a href="/wiki/Digital_sequence_information" title="Digital sequence information">digital sequence information</a> and <a href="/wiki/Biopiracy" title="Biopiracy">biopiracy</a>, a phenomenon that had been disproportionately affecting countries in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Global_South" title="Global South">Global South</a>, and ensure the full involvement of <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_peoples" title="Indigenous peoples">Indigenous peoples</a> around the world, which had been mentioned eighteen times on the GBF, in the implementation of the targets set by the Framework itself. Finally, a draft of a global action plan on biodiversity and health was reportedly set to be negotiated at the conference.
</p><p>Upon being asked about the likelihood that the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> would ratify the convention, having previously refused to do so, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Executive_secretary" title="Executive secretary">executive secretary</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Convention_on_Biological_Diversity" title="Convention on Biological Diversity">Convention on Biological Diversity</a>, Astrid Schomaker, said that while the US were "always participating at the COPs with reasonably big delegations", ratification had not been an "actively discussed" subject in the country, regardless of the outcome of the <a href="/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election" title="2024 United States presidential election">2024 presidential election</a>, due to a lack of support from a solid majority of <a href="/wiki/United_States_Congress" title="United States Congress">Congress</a>.
</p><p>Schomaker also said that the COP16 would be "the biggest COP ever", thanks to the involvement of a higher number of stakeholders and national delegates, as well as an increase in international media coverage; she also noted how the meeting would be an opportunity for institutions to acknowledge that "we cannot solve the climate crisis without looking at the nature crisis".

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading4"><h4 id="Killings_of_environmental_activists">Killings of environmental activists</h4></div>
<p>According to a yearly <a href="/wiki/Global_Witness" title="Global Witness">Global Witness</a> report about victims of violence and repression against <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Environmental_activism" title="Environmental activism">environmental activism</a>, released in September 2024, 196 environmentalists and activists around the world had been murdered throughout 2023. Colombia topped the list for the second year in a row, with 79 killings (19 more than the year prior), followed by Brazil, with 25 killings, and by Mexico and <a href="/wiki/Honduras" title="Honduras">Honduras</a>, with 18 killings per each. Global Witness said that organized crime groups had been linked to around half of all environmental defender murders in Colombia in 2023, while noting that half of the activists killed in Colombia were <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Colombia" title="Indigenous peoples in Colombia">Indigenous</a>, with many others being either members of <a href="/wiki/Afro-Colombians" title="Afro-Colombians">Afro-descendant communities</a> or small-scale farmers.
</p><p>The report also raised concerns about growing repression and censorship of protests led by environmentalist associations in several countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Italy, <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>.

On 30 July, the leader of the EMC, Néstor Gregorio (also known by the <a href="/wiki/Nom_de_guerre" title="Nom de guerre">nom de guerre</a> Iván Mordisco), announced that the units of the group would not affect any events related to the COP16 "as a gesture of [their] will for peace".
</p><p>The executive secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity, Astrid Schomaker, said that her staff had "worked very closely" with national, regional and local authorities to arrange effective security arrangements for the COP16.

<p>On 21 October 2024, the inaugural day of the meeting, Muhamad presented Colombia's own NBSAP, called <i>Plan de Acción por la Biodiversidad 2030</i> ("Plan of Action for Biodiversity 2030"). The document — which was estimated to require a total investment of 76.5 billion <a href="/wiki/Colombian_peso" title="Colombian peso">pesos</a>, roughly corresponding to over US$17.8 billion — set six national goals and 191 targets needed to fulfill the 2022 Global Biodiversity Framework by the end of the decade. The opening ceremony included public speeches by Muhamad and Petro, as well as the major counselor of the <a href="/wiki/National_Indigenous_Organization_of_Colombia" title="National Indigenous Organization of Colombia">National Indigenous Organization of Colombia</a> (ONIC), Orlando Rayo, and a video-message from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Secretary-general_of_the_United_Nations" title="Secretary-general of the United Nations">secretary-general of the United Nations</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ant%C3%B3nio_Guterres" title="António Guterres">António Guterres</a>, who urged participating diplomats to "go from words to facts" in order to fulfill the targets set by the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.
</p><p>While the COP16 was taking place, a group of researchers from the <a href="/wiki/Natural_History_Museum,_London" title="Natural History Museum, London">Natural History Museum</a> in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> presented an independent analysis on the effectiveness of conservation practices worldwide, which showed that, on average, biodiversity intactness had declined globally between 2000 and 2020, diminishing more quickly in places that are considered to be <a href="/wiki/Protected_area" title="Protected area">protected areas</a> than in critical biodiversity areas that were not protected; the study also estimated that 17.5% of land and 8.4% of marine areas were protected for nature – an increase of about half a percentage point each since the <a href="/wiki/2022_United_Nations_Biodiversity_Conference" title="2022 United Nations Biodiversity Conference">COP15</a> in 2022 – with the total amount being expected to reach at least 30% by 2030, as part of one of the targets set by the GBF.
</p><p>During the first week of the convention, representatives of <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_peoples" title="Indigenous peoples">Indigenous</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Afro-Descendant" title="Afro-Descendant">Afro-descendant</a> communities, as well as <a href="/wiki/Civil_society" title="Civil society">civil society</a> associations, were involved in dedicated international forums. <i><a href="/wiki/El_Colombiano" title="El Colombiano">El Colombiano</a></i> reported that five "key documents" related to the targets set by the <a href="/wiki/Cartagena_Protocol_on_Biosafety" title="Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety">Cartagena</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nagoya_Protocol" title="Nagoya Protocol">Nagoya Protocols</a> were adopted in the ending session of the week, while new preliminary agreements to reform <a href="/wiki/Wildlife_conservation" title="Wildlife conservation">wildlife conservation</a> and sustainable practices within the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Agricultural_sector" title="Agricultural sector">agricultural</a>, <a href="/wiki/Food_industry" title="Food industry">food</a> and <a href="/wiki/Financial_services" title="Financial services">financial</a> sectors were also reached.
</p><p>Negotiations about a plan to provide developing countries with more resources for the implementation of conservation targets by 2030 reportedly kept stalling during the second week of the meeting, as a request by developing countries, including Brazil, to create a new fund for biodiversity, faced opposition by donating countries and the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a>. A spokesperson for the CBD committee, David Ainsworth, said that it was "obvious" that a complete agreement on the subject would not be reached by the end of  COP16, with delegates being set to continue negotiations in the following period of time, as part of a new organization or an existent <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">UN</a> body. Some analysts and participants also noted how the funding for developing countries required by the GBF was "a drop in the sea" in comparison to incentives paid by governments to providers of <a href="/wiki/Pollution#Environment" title="Pollution">nature-damaging sources</a>.

<p>The conference closed on 2 November 2024, with no agreement on a roadmap to ramp up funding for species protection. It was suspended as negotiations ran almost twelve hours longer than planned and delegates started leaving to catch flights. The exodus left the summit without a quorum for decision-making.
</p><p>Delegates did agree earlier to form a subsidiary body for recognizing Indigenous peoples' role, including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Traditional_Environmental_Knowledge" title="Traditional Environmental Knowledge">traditional environmental knowledge</a>, in future decisions on conservation. The body is led by two co-chairs, one of which is nominated by UN parties of the regional group and the other nominated by indigenous peoples and local communities. The role of people of African descent in the protection of nature was also recognized.
</p><p>An agreement was also reached earlier on charging large biotechnology companies who derive genetic information from living organisms with a 0.1% fee. The fee is to recognize that many life-saving medicines and genetic resources are derived from organisms living in biodiversity hotspots, such as the <a href="/wiki/Tropical_rainforest" title="Tropical rainforest">tropical rainforest</a>. The collected fee was set to go into a newly established fund to protect nature, with 50% allocated towards Indigenous communities.

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Extended_session_in_Rome">Extended session in Rome</h3></div>
<p>An extended session of the COP16 was held in <a href="/wiki/Rome" title="Rome">Rome, Italy</a>, at the headquarters of the <a href="/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization" title="Food and Agriculture Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization</a>, from 25 to 27 February 2025. The president of the conference, Susana Muhamad, took part in the meetings, despite having resigned from her role as Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development of Colombia on 9 February, in protests to cabinet appointments by President Gustavo Petro. Several countries did not send representatives to the session, including the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, which had not signed up to the <a href="/wiki/Convention_on_Biological_Diversity" title="Convention on Biological Diversity">Convention on Biological Diversity</a> and had just entered the <a href="/wiki/Second_presidency_of_Donald_Trump" title="Second presidency of Donald Trump">second Trump administration</a>, which was raising concerns over its plans to retreat from international environmental diplomacy and foreign aid.
</p><p>Participating countries officially agreed to create the Cali Fund, which aimed to provide Indigenous peoples and countries with the highest concentration of biodiversity with <a href="/wiki/Financial_compensation" title="Financial compensation">financial compensation</a> from <a href="/wiki/Biotechnology" title="Biotechnology">biotech companies</a> that had used <a href="/wiki/Digital_sequence_information" title="Digital sequence information">digital sequence information</a> (DSI) of <a href="/wiki/Native_species" title="Native species">native species</a> for commercial purposes without permission. As part of the agreement, companies that met two of three criteria – sales of more than $50m (£39m), profits of more than $5m, and $20m in total assets – were expected to contribute 0.1% of profits generated from usage of DSI, or 1% of their <a href="/wiki/Revenue" title="Revenue">revenue</a>, towards the fund on a voluntary basis; half of all resources collected by the fund would be donated to Indigenous communities who were taking care of the most biodiverse ecosystems. The announcement of the Cali Fund received mixed reactions from environmentalist organizations: the <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature" title="World Wide Fund for Nature">WWF</a> considered it a "good measure of <a href="/wiki/Environmental_justice" title="Environmental justice">environmental justice</a>", whereas <a href="/wiki/Agroecology" title="Agroecology">agroecologist</a> association Centro Internazionale Crocevia criticized the agreement, expressing concerns over the voluntary nature of the fund and the risk of lacking resources for Indigenous communities.
</p><p>On 28 February, it was announced that the participating countries had reached an agreement on a roadmap to provide developing countries with US$200 billion a year – roughly <a href="/wiki/Euro" title="Euro">€</a>192.5 billion – to finance the implementation of conservation targets by 2030, in compliance to the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. The plan included commitment to raise US$20 billion in annual conservation financing by 2025, with the assets being set to rise to US$30 billion annually by 2030; according to the latest data collected at the time by the <a href="/wiki/OECD" title="OECD">OECD</a>, countries had managed to raise just US$15 billion towards the same goals. <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_finance" title="Ministry of finance">Ministers of finance</a> and <a href="/wiki/List_of_environmental_ministries" title="List of environmental ministries">environment</a> from all of the countries were also expected to hold an "international dialogue" to ensure the targets would be reached. The consequent progress would be reviewed at the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=2026_United_Nations_Biodiversity_Conference&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="2026 United Nations Biodiversity Conference (page does not exist)">COP17</a> in 2026, hosted by <a href="/wiki/Armenia" title="Armenia">Armenia</a>. The members of the <a href="/wiki/BRICS" title="BRICS">BRICS</a> group, and most specifically <a href="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, reportedly played a central role in influencing the positive outcome of the negotiations; the Brazilian delegation, led by <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Maria_Ang%C3%A9lica_Ikeda&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Maria Angélica Ikeda (page does not exist)">Maria Angélica Ikeda</a>, was credited with putting forward a proposal that would become the basis of the final compromise.
</p><p>On the other hand, negotiations on a new fund for nature finance were suspended and postponed to 2028, due to disagreements between the delegations involved on the status of the <a href="/wiki/Global_Environment_Facility" title="Global Environment Facility">Global Environment Facility</a> (GEF). Developing countries, including Brazil and the <a href="/wiki/African_Group" title="African Group">African Group</a>, considered the GEF as too burdensome to access and over-representing wealthier nations, and demanded the creation of a newly established fund. hosted by COP committees. Developed countries, including the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a>, <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, opposed the idea, arguing that multiple conservation funds could fragment international aid, while focusing on plausible efforts to broaden potential financial sources towards conservation, including private investments or the reform of environmentally harmful subsidies.
