<p>Domingos da Silva Soares was born on 12 May 1952 in the <a href="/wiki/Sucos_of_Timor-Leste" title="Sucos of Timor-Leste">village</a> of <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Dukurai&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Dukurai (page does not exist)">Dukurai</a> in <a href="/wiki/Letefoho_Administrative_Post" title="Letefoho Administrative Post">Letefoho</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ermera_Municipality" title="Ermera Municipality">Ermera</a>, a coffee-growing area in what was then <a href="/wiki/Portuguese_Timor" title="Portuguese Timor">Portuguese Timor</a>. His parents, Isaias José Soares and Teresa da Silva Soares, were farmers. Two weeks after his birth, his family moved to <a href="/wiki/Fatubessi,_Ermera" title="Fatubessi, Ermera">Fatubessi</a>, where he was <a href="/wiki/Baptism" title="Baptism">baptized</a> in 1956 at the local chapel. In 1960, Soares entered primary school at the Catholic mission in <a href="/wiki/Ermera" title="Ermera">Ermera</a>. He later studied at the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Col%C3%A9gio_Infante_de_Sagres&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Colégio Infante de Sagres (page does not exist)">Colégio Infante de Sagres</a> in <a href="/wiki/Maliana" title="Maliana">Maliana</a>, where he received his <a href="/wiki/First_Communion" title="First Communion">first communion</a> in 1964. Soares' family described him as a diligent and helpful boy who felt a calling to service in the church from a young age. As a <a href="/wiki/Preadolescence" title="Preadolescence">preteen</a>, Soares fetched firewood and water for his family during the day, and taught <a href="/wiki/Catechism" title="Catechism">catechism</a> in the evenings with the support of an older woman in the community.
</p><p>In 1966, Soares began his priestly formation at the Pré-Seminário São Francisco Xavier in <a href="/wiki/Dare,_Dili" title="Dare, Dili">Dare</a>, where he received the sacrament of <a href="/wiki/Confirmation" title="Confirmation">confirmation</a> in 1967 from Bishop <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_Joaquim_Ribeiro&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="José Joaquim Ribeiro (page does not exist)">José Joaquim Ribeiro</a>.

In October 1973, Soares went to <a href="/wiki/Portugal" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>, where he entered the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Semin%C3%A1rio_Conciliar_de_S%C3%A3o_Pedro_e_S%C3%A3o_Paulo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Seminário Conciliar de São Pedro e São Paulo (page does not exist)">Seminário Conciliar de São Pedro e São Paulo</a> in <a href="/wiki/Braga" title="Braga">Braga</a>.<b></b> After a <a href="/wiki/Propaedeutics" title="Propaedeutics">propaedeutic</a> year, he studied philosophy and theology between 1974 and 1978.<b></b> On 12 March 1978, he was ordained a <a href="/wiki/Deacon" title="Deacon">deacon</a> by Bishop <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Manuel_Ferreira_Cabral&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Manuel Ferreira Cabral (page does not exist)">Manuel Ferreira Cabral</a>, <a href="/wiki/Auxiliary_bishop" title="Auxiliary bishop">auxiliary bishop</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Braga" title="Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Braga">Archdiocese of Braga</a>.

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Priesthood">Priesthood</h2></div>
<p>After his ordination in 1978, Soares spent six months at a parish in <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Castel%C3%B5es_(Vila_Nova_de_Famalic%C3%A3o)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Castelões (Vila Nova de Famalicão) (page does not exist)">Castelões</a>, where he celebrated his first <a href="/wiki/Mass_in_the_Catholic_Church" title="Mass in the Catholic Church">mass</a>. He then spent around a year as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Parochial_vicar" title="Parochial vicar">parochial vicar</a> of the main church in <a href="/wiki/P%C3%B3voa_de_Varzim" title="Póvoa de Varzim">Póvoa de Varzim</a>. In 1975, while Soares was studying in Portugal, <a href="/wiki/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> <a href="/wiki/Indonesian_invasion_of_East_Timor" title="Indonesian invasion of East Timor">invaded</a> and <a href="/wiki/Indonesian_occupation_of_East_Timor" title="Indonesian occupation of East Timor">occupied</a> East Timor, <a href="/wiki/Annexation" title="Annexation">annexing</a> it as <a href="/wiki/East_Timor_(province)" title="East Timor (province)">an Indonesian province</a> the following year. During this time, Soares' family fled their homes and went to live in the bush.<b></b> They did not know Soares had already been ordained a priest, and Soares did not know whether his family was still alive or not.<b></b> While in Portugal, he received a letter informing him that his parents were still alive, but he was skeptical.<b></b>
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Independence_struggle">Independence struggle</h3></div>
<p>In May 1980, Soares returned to East Timor.<b></b> Upon arriving at the airport, he asked about his parents and learned that his mother had already passed away, but that his father was still alive. On 10 June 1980, Soares was named pastor of Santa Teresinha do Menino Jesus parish in <a href="/wiki/Ossu,_Timor-Leste" title="Ossu, Timor-Leste">Ossu</a>, <a href="/wiki/Viqueque_Municipality" title="Viqueque Municipality">Viqueque</a> district, which also covered <a href="/wiki/Lacluta_Administrative_Post" title="Lacluta Administrative Post">Lacluta</a> and <a href="/wiki/Viqueque" title="Viqueque">Viqueque</a> town. The area was heavily patrolled by the Indonesians, and was the site of much violence and persecution against civilians. In Ossu, Soares quickly became involved the resistance struggle against the <a href="/wiki/Indonesian_occupation_of_East_Timor" title="Indonesian occupation of East Timor">Indonesian occupation</a>, and it was it there that he earned the nickname "Maubere". <i>Maubere</i> is a loose term that refers to ordinary, indigenous East Timorese people, often used by members of the nationalist movement to mean "of the people" in the context of the struggle against the Indonesian occupation.
</p><p>In 1982, Soares was appointed superior of the mission in <a href="/wiki/Uato-Lari_Administrative_Post" title="Uato-Lari Administrative Post">Uatolari</a> and president of the catechetical commission of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Dili" title="Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dili">Diocese of Dili</a>. The following year, he was named director of the Instituto Pastoral in <a href="/wiki/Dili" title="Dili">Dili</a>. Soares was often threatened by the Indonesian authorities, and in 1983, he was placed under <a href="/wiki/House_arrest" title="House arrest">house arrest</a>. In 1988, he was relocated from Ossu to Dili, where he continued his resistance activities. He maintained contact with pro-independence leaders like <a href="/wiki/Xanana_Gusm%C3%A3o" title="Xanana Gusmão">Xanana Gusmão</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nino_Konis_Santana" title="Nino Konis Santana">Nino Konis Santana</a>, and supported guerrilla fighters with medicine, food, and money. As a priest, Soares traveled from place to place, offering spiritual care to people in areas under Indonesian control. In this role, he also passed information between guerrillas and civilian resistance groups. He also established contacts with East Timor solidarity groups in <a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, with whom he shared and received information related to the resistance struggle.
</p><p>Soares believed the independence struggle was not just political but also a religious "holy war" between the Catholic East Timorese and the Muslim Indonesians. He defended the guerrillas' use of violence, arguing "If they see people with weapons pointed at them, they have the right to self defense." In May 1990, Soares and 15 other East Timorese Catholic priests signed the "Reflection of the Indigenous Priests" (<a href="/wiki/Portuguese_language" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a>: <i>Reflexão dos Sacerdotes Autóctones</i>) arguing in favor of political involvement by the church. Soares' zealous views and overt manner sometimes put him at odds with other pro-independence figures in the church, like Bishop <a href="/wiki/Carlos_Filipe_Ximenes_Belo" title="Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo">Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo</a> and Father <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Mario_Belo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Mario Belo (page does not exist)">Mario Belo</a>, who preferred a subtler approach.
</p><p>On 5 August 1990, Soares was appointed pastor of the parish in <a href="/wiki/Suai" title="Suai">Suai</a>, a town on the south coast. On 16 July 1994, he became pastor of Nossa Senhora do Carmo parish in his home district of <a href="/wiki/Letefoho_Administrative_Post" title="Letefoho Administrative Post">Letefoho</a>, where he remained until 1997. In 1995, Soares helped a group of young people, among them members of the clandestine resistance including <a href="/wiki/Alfredo_Reinado" title="Alfredo Reinado">Alfredo Reinado</a>, escape East Timor to Australia from <a href="/wiki/Tibar_Bay" title="Tibar Bay">Tibar Bay</a>, just west of Dili. Before the group's departure, Soares married Reinado and Maria Alves and baptized the couple's six-month-old baby. He then handed a crucifix to each member of the group before telling them, "My children, if I have not heard any news about you in seven days, I will bring candles and flowers to the sea to remember you as heroes of your country." He then hid among the <a href="/wiki/Mangrove" title="Mangrove">mangroves</a> as the boat departed. The group arrived in Australia six days later.
</p><p>On 17 August 1997, a pro-Indonesian militia leader came to Soares' church in Letefoho, insulted him, and fired five gunshots at the church's facade before people intervened to stop him. That year, Soares went into exile in Portugal amid pressure from the Indonesian authorities. In July 1997, Soares and an East Timorese laywoman, Maria de Lourdes Cruz, were awarded the <a href="/wiki/Pax_Christi_International_Peace_Award" title="Pax Christi International Peace Award">Pax Christi International Peace Award</a>, in recognition of their work with poor communities in East Timor. Soares received his award from Cardinal <a href="/wiki/Godfried_Danneels" title="Godfried Danneels">Godfried Danneels</a> in a ceremony at <a href="/wiki/St_Mary%27s_University,_Twickenham" title="St Mary's University, Twickenham">St Mary's University</a> in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>. At the event, he drew attention to Indonesian human rights violations in East Timor, where he said the people "live in hope and cry day and night for liberation." While in exile in Portugal, Soares and another priest, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Filomeno_Jacob&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Filomeno Jacob (page does not exist)">Filomeno Jacob</a>, worked with political leaders to establish a unified organization representing the East Timorese resistance movement. Their efforts manifested in the 1988 founding congress of the <a href="/wiki/National_Council_of_Maubere_Resistance" title="National Council of Maubere Resistance">National Council of Maubere Resistance</a> (CNRT) in <a href="/wiki/Peniche,_Portugal" title="Peniche, Portugal">Peniche</a>, Portugal. Upon returning to East Timor, Soares served as the CNRT's general coordinator and spokesman.
</p><p>During the <a href="/wiki/1999_East_Timorese_crisis" title="1999 East Timorese crisis">crisis</a> following the <a href="/wiki/1999_East_Timorese_independence_referendum" title="1999 East Timorese independence referendum">1999 East Timorese independence referendum</a>, Soares went to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mount_Ramelau" title="Mount Ramelau">Mount Ramelau</a> to escape the violence, where he spent time in prayer. Beginning in 2001, he served on the steering committee that led to the establishment of the <a href="/wiki/Commission_for_Reception,_Truth_and_Reconciliation_in_East_Timor" title="Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor">Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor</a>, which investigated and documented human rights violations in East Timor between 1974–1999 and facilitated reconciliation between victims and perpetrators. On 1 September 2002, Soares became pastor of Nossa Senhora de Lourdes parish in <a href="/wiki/Ermera" title="Ermera">Ermera</a>, a post he held until <abbr title="circa">c.</abbr> 2005.

Soares was a leading figure in the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=2005_Timor-Leste_protests&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="2005 Timor-Leste protests (page does not exist)">April–May 2005 protests</a> in which thousands demonstrated against Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Mari_Alkatiri" title="Mari Alkatiri">Mari Alkatiri</a> and the ruling <a href="/wiki/Fretilin" title="Fretilin">Fretilin</a> party in response to a proposal to remove Catholic religious education as a mandatory subject in government schools. Soares participated in the protests daily, often using a microphone to lead the crowd in prayer and to denounce the government. On 21 April, he declared that "the people and the Catholic Church have joined peacefully for an end to this extremist government. We want the Alkatiri government to step down and for Fretilin to choose another." Timor-Leste's Catholic bishops, <a href="/wiki/Alberto_Ricardo_da_Silva" title="Alberto Ricardo da Silva">Alberto Ricardo da Silva</a> of <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Dili" title="Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dili">Dili</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bas%C3%ADlio_do_Nascimento" title="Basílio do Nascimento">Basílio do Nascimento</a> of <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Baucau" title="Roman Catholic Diocese of Baucau">Baucau</a>, supported the protests and released a document, signed by Soares in his role as a church spokesman, outlining constitutional justifications for their calls for Alkatiri's resignation. An agreement was ultimately signed between Alkatiri and the bishops restoring Catholic education as a mandatory school subject.
</p><p>Afterwards, Soares remained critical of Fretilin. In January 2006, national media reported that Soares had said in a sermon in <a href="/wiki/Same,_Timor-Leste" title="Same, Timor-Leste">Same</a> that Fretilin was communist and would kill all of Timor-Leste's priests and nuns if they won the next general election. In response, the party's parliamentary leader, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Francisco_Miranda_Branco&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Francisco Miranda Branco (page does not exist)">Francisco Miranda Branco</a>, accused Soares of carrying out a systematic campaign to take down Fretilin. A Fretilin member of parliament, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Maria_Jos%C3%A9_da_Costa&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Maria José da Costa (page does not exist)">Maria José da Costa</a>, later said that Soares never made such statements about Fretilin in Same, and that those reports were part of a scheme to discredit the party. In 2007, Soares accused the government of withholding rice supplies and giving them to Fretilin supporters, a claim that Deputy Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Estanislau_da_Silva" title="Estanislau da Silva">Estanislau da Silva</a> called "irresponsible."
</p><p>During the <a href="/wiki/2006_crisis_in_Timor-Leste" title="2006 crisis in Timor-Leste">April–June 2006 crisis in Timor-Leste</a>, interior minister <a href="/wiki/Rog%C3%A9rio_Lobato" title="Rogério Lobato">Rogério Lobato</a> accused some clergy of supporting the "petitioners group"—the defecting <a href="/wiki/Timor-Leste_Defence_Force" title="Timor-Leste Defence Force">Timor-Leste Defence Force</a> (F-FDTL) soldiers and their supporters, who were protesting in Dili. Soares responded that "the church is everywhere to attend to the cries and suffering of the people" and that the church was providing counsel to the petitioners to help resolve the crisis peacefully. Soares' home in Dili was set on fire at the height the crisis in May 2006. In March 2007, in the aftermath of the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Same" title="Battle of Same">Battle of Same</a>, a failed attempt by Australian forces to apprehend rebel leader and F-FDTL defector <a href="/wiki/Alfredo_Reinado" title="Alfredo Reinado">Alfredo Reinado</a>, the government considered using Soares as a mediator. At a meeting on 9 March 2007 between Australian diplomats and East Timorese political leaders, the speaker of parliament, <a href="/wiki/Francisco_Guterres" title="Francisco Guterres">Francisco Guterres</a> suggested that Soares, known to be sympathetic to Reinado, could talk to the rebel leader on behalf of the government to negotiate his surrender.
</p><p>In 2008, Soares went to <a href="/wiki/Macau" title="Macau">Macau</a>, where he worked at the <a href="/wiki/Cathedral_of_the_Nativity_of_Our_Lady,_Macau" title="Cathedral of the Nativity of Our Lady, Macau">Cathedral of the Nativity of Our Lady</a> while studying for his master's degree in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Religious_sciences" title="Religious sciences">religious sciences</a>, and later his doctorate, at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Saint_Joseph" title="University of Saint Joseph">University of Saint Joseph</a>. In 2010, he helped to reactivate Grupo Macau Rai Timor, an East Timorese association in Macau, which was established by another East Timorese priest in 1996. In 2013, he was appointed vicar of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Macau" title="Roman Catholic Diocese of Macau">Diocese of Macau</a>'s ministry for Portuguese-speaking Catholics. In February 2015, he returned to Timor-Leste, having been called unexpectedly to serve as <a href="/wiki/Vicar_general" title="Vicar general">vicar general</a> of the Diocese of Dili by Bishop Alberto da Silva. He returned to Macau in 2016 to complete his doctorate in <a href="/wiki/Christian_studies" title="Christian studies">Christian studies</a>, with a dissertation titled <i>The Diocese of Macau at the dawn of the Diocese of Dili</i> (<a href="/wiki/Portuguese_language" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a>: <i>A Diocese de Macau no alvorecer da Diocese de Dili</i>). In July 2017, he left Macau and returned to Timor-Leste. After his departure, he remained involved with a support group for East Timorese Catholic seminarians studying in Macau.
