<p>Friedländer was born Anni Margot Bendheim in <a href="/wiki/Berlin" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> on 5 November 1921 and raised on <span title="German-language text"><span lang="de">Lindenstraße</span></span> in the <span title="German-language text"><span lang="de"><a href="/wiki/Kreuzberg" title="Kreuzberg">Kreuzberg</a></span></span> district. Her family owned a button factory that supplied to local fashion studios in the Jewish textile quarter. When she was 11 years old, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nazis_came_to_power" title="Nazis came to power">Nazis came to power</a>. She enrolled at an arts and crafts school in Berlin in 1936, and trained to be a fashion illustrator. She worked as a seamstress and at the <a href="/wiki/VDO_(company)" title="VDO (company)">Deuta</a> factory on <span title="German-language text"><span lang="de">Oranienstraße</span></span>, and wanted to design clothes.
</p><p>By 1938, the increasing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nazi_persecution_of_Jews" title="Nazi persecution of Jews">persecution of Jews</a> forced many to flee or go into hiding. In 1938, at the age of 17, Friedländer witnessed the <a href="/wiki/Kristallnacht" title="Kristallnacht">pogrom against Jewish shops and synagogues</a>. Her mother was keen to emigrate but her father, who was a war veteran, would not leave the country. Other sources claim that her father emigrated to Belgium soon after her parents divorced and before the war began.
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Persecution_by_the_Nazis">Persecution by the Nazis</h2></div>
<p>After her parents divorced, Friedländer and her brother Ralph remained with their mother, Auguste Bendheim. Her mother had made several failed attempts to emigrate.
</p><p>On 20 January 1943, Friedländer was returning home when she noticed a man standing outside the door of the family's apartment on the second floor. She could not leave, so she hid her <a href="/wiki/Yellow_badge" title="Yellow badge">Jewish star</a> and walked past him, continuing instead to a neighbour's apartment on the third floor. The neighbour confirmed that the <a href="/wiki/Gestapo" title="Gestapo">Gestapo</a> had visited and arrested 17-year-old Ralph. Friedländer's mother had not been in the apartment at the time, and fled to a Jewish couple in Kreuzberg who were her friends, later turning herself in to the Gestapo in order to protect her son. Friedländer learned of their fate at the couple's home, where she was given her mother's handbag, which contained an address book and an amber necklace. She also received a verbal message from her mother: "<span title="German-language text"><span lang="de">Versuche, dein Leben zu machen</span></span>" (Try to make your life). Friedländer stated, "These words shaped my life."
</p><p>In January 1943, her mother and brother were taken to <a href="/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp" title="Auschwitz concentration camp">Auschwitz concentration camp</a>, where they were murdered. Friedländer's father was also murdered at Auschwitz. Friedländer did not discover what had happened to her family until decades later.
</p><p>Friedländer continued to live alone in hiding in Berlin. She often moved hiding places after dark due to Allied air raids and was aided by an underground network of 16 unnamed Germans. She survived by living under a false identity that involved dyeing her hair red and removing her Jewish star from her coat. She wore a cross on a chain and a doctor operated on her nose to alter her appearance. Eventually she was betrayed by Jewish <span title="German-language text"><i lang="de">Greifer</i></span> (<abbr style="font-size:85%" title="literal translation">lit.</abbr><span style="white-space: nowrap;"> </span><span class="gloss-quot">'</span><span class="gloss-text">grabbers</span><span class="gloss-quot">'</span>), who were Jews that revealed those in hiding to the Nazis. In April 1944, she was leaving a bomb shelter when two police officers checked her identity. She was taken to a police station and on the way admitted that she was Jewish.
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Theresienstadt_concentration_camp">Theresienstadt concentration camp</h3></div>
<p>Friedländer was transported to <a href="/wiki/Theresienstadt_Ghetto" title="Theresienstadt Ghetto">Theresienstadt camp</a> located in the present-day <a href="/wiki/Czech_Republic" title="Czech Republic">Czech Republic</a>. She described life in the camp as "cruel" and only survived because she arrived near the end of the war. There she met her future husband, Adolf Friedländer. They had met each other previously in Berlin at the Jewish Cultural Association. At Theresienstadt she witnessed the arrival of evacuated inmates from Auschwitz who had been on the road for three months, having been sent a few days before the liberation on 27 January 1945. She said, "You couldn't tell the living from the dead. People who hardly looked like people anymore. Almost everyone wore striped pajamas". The <a href="/wiki/Schutzstaffel" title="Schutzstaffel">SS</a> left the camp on 5 May 1945 and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Red_Cross" title="Red Cross">Red Cross</a> vehicles arrived. She said that no one in the camp noticed: "Nobody was happy, nobody changed their daily routine." On 8 May, the <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" title="Red Army">Soviet Army</a> took command of the camp. She was initially reluctant to leave for fear of being shot.
</p><p>Immediately after the liberation, Adolf proposed to her. She said, "I wasn't in love with Adolf. I needed time to become human again. It was the same for Adolf. The pain brought us closer together than being in love." They were married at Theresienstadt by a <a href="/wiki/Rabbi" title="Rabbi">rabbi</a> on 26 June 1945, six weeks after the liberation. They then spent a year in a displaced persons camp in <a href="/wiki/Deggendorf" title="Deggendorf">Deggendorf</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lower_Bavaria" title="Lower Bavaria">Lower Bavaria</a>.
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Emigration_to_the_United_States">Emigration to the United States</h2></div>
<p>In 1946, Friedländer and her husband moved to the United States and lived in <a href="/wiki/Queens" title="Queens">Queens, New York</a>. There she worked as a travel agent and as a seamstress. They both swore never to return to Germany. After her husband's death in 1997, Friedländer decided to take classes at the <a href="/wiki/92nd_Street_Y" title="92nd Street Y">92nd Street Y</a>, where she took a memoir class and began to write about her memories of life in Nazi Germany. She recalled, "I had all these stories in my head. Everything started coming back to me, many things that I pushed aside for years". German filmmaker and producer <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Halaczinsky" title="Thomas Halaczinsky">Thomas Halaczinsky</a> took an interest in her memoir and wanted to make a documentary of her life, which required her to return to Berlin. In 2003, she agreed to the documentary. When they arrived in Berlin, she walked Halaczinsky around the streets, remembering every building with ease. This motivated her to return to Berlin permanently. She said, "I felt I was home again". The documentary, titled <i>Don't Call It <span title="German-language text"><span lang="de">Heimweh</span></span>,</i> premiered at the <a href="/wiki/Woodstock_Film_Festival" title="Woodstock Film Festival">Woodstock Film Festival</a> in October 2004.
</p><p>The Berlin Senate invited Friedländer to visit Berlin as part of a visitor program for persecuted and emigrated citizens. After accepting the invitation, she visited her old apartment building on <span title="German-language text"><span lang="de">Skalitzer Straße</span></span>. She became friends with the Berlin Secretary of State for Culture, André Schmitz. She began to visit Berlin often and when she was in New York, she wrote her autobiography and published it in 2008.
