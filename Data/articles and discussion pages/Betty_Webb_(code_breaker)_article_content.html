In 1941 she joined the British <a href="/wiki/Auxiliary_Territorial_Service" title="Auxiliary Territorial Service">Auxiliary Territorial Service</a>. She said, of joining the top-secret mission at Bletchley, "I wanted to do something more for the war effort than bake <a href="/wiki/Sausage_roll" title="Sausage roll">sausage rolls</a>."

<p>Webb was born on 13 May 1923, in Ryecroft, <a href="/wiki/Richard%27s_Castle" title="Richard's Castle">Richard's Castle</a>, <a href="/wiki/Herefordshire" title="Herefordshire">Herefordshire</a>. She was named after her mother, Charlotte, but was commonly referred to as "Betty". She described her childhood as 'idyllic' and was home-schooled for a significant portion of her youth. Her mother gave her and her brother home-school lessons. She was studying <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Domestic_Science" title="Domestic Science">Domestic Science</a> at <a href="/wiki/Shrewsbury_College" title="Shrewsbury College">Radbrook College</a> in <a href="/wiki/Shrewsbury" title="Shrewsbury">Shrewsbury</a> at the start of World War II. She signed up to join the <a href="/wiki/Auxiliary_Territorial_Service" title="Auxiliary Territorial Service">Auxiliary Territorial Service</a> as soon as she turned 18 in May 1941, and did basic training at the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Welch_Fusiliers" title="Royal Welch Fusiliers">Royal Welch Fusiliers</a>' <a href="/wiki/Hightown_Barracks" title="Hightown Barracks">Hightown Barracks</a> in <a href="/wiki/Wrexham" title="Wrexham">Wrexham</a>. From there she was taken to an interview in London at <a href="/wiki/Devonshire_House" title="Devonshire House">Devonshire House</a> and then sent immediately to <a href="/wiki/Bletchley_Park" title="Bletchley Park">Bletchley Park</a> in Buckinghamshire.

<p>Upon arrival at Bletchley Park, she was tasked with cataloguing encrypted German radio messages intercepted by the British, contributing to the breaking of the German cipher <a href="/wiki/Cryptanalysis_of_the_Enigma" title="Cryptanalysis of the Enigma">Enigma</a>. While a bulk of Bletchley Park workers were assigned to one of the huts, such as Hut 3, Hut 11, Webb was mainly situated in the Mansion belonging to <a href="/wiki/Ralph_Tester" title="Ralph Tester">Major Tester</a>'s department and Block F, the Japanese section. In Major Tester's department, some tasks performed include registering messages on little cards, which Webb believes totalled 10,000 a day in the whole park, and organizing the cards into shoeboxes according to a strict order so they could be retrieved efficiently when called for. In Block F, she worked on intercepted Japanese messages, something she excelled at so much that she was later sent to <a href="/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington</a> to support the American war effort.
</p><p>All recruits to Bletchley Park were taken into a room and asked to read and then sign the <a href="/wiki/Official_Secrets_Act" title="Official Secrets Act">Official Secrets Act</a> before they could begin their work. The strict secrecy meant workers could not share what they did at work with their families, friends, or even with their fellow Bletchley workers. Only after the veil of secrecy was partially lifted, in the late 1970s, were Betty Webb and others who had worked at Bletchley, finally able to understand what had really been going on at the site.
