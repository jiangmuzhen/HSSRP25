<p>On March 11, 2025, former Philippine president <a href="/wiki/Rodrigo_Duterte" title="Rodrigo Duterte">Rodrigo Duterte</a> was arrested by the <a href="/wiki/Philippine_National_Police" title="Philippine National Police">Philippine National Police</a> and <a href="/wiki/Interpol" title="Interpol">Interpol</a> in <b>Operation Pursuit</b> under an <a href="/wiki/International_Criminal_Court" title="International Criminal Court">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) warrant charging him with <a href="/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity" title="Crimes against humanity">crimes against humanity</a> related to the <a href="/wiki/Philippine_drug_war" title="Philippine drug war">Philippine drug war</a>. Duterte arrived at <a href="/wiki/Ninoy_Aquino_International_Airport" title="Ninoy Aquino International Airport">Ninoy Aquino International Airport</a> in <a href="/wiki/Metro_Manila" title="Metro Manila">Metro Manila</a> on March 11 after attending a political rally in <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>. Once the warrant was executed, he was held in custody at the nearby <a href="/wiki/Villamor_Air_Base" title="Villamor Air Base">Villamor Air Base</a> and then transferred to the Netherlands, where he is expected to face trial in <a href="/wiki/The_Hague" title="The Hague">The Hague</a>. The operation was largely planned by police general <a href="/wiki/Nicolas_Torre" title="Nicolas Torre">Nicolas Torre</a>.
</p><p>Duterte was indicted on charges of crimes against humanity, which include <a href="/wiki/Extrajudicial_killing" title="Extrajudicial killing">extrajudicial killings</a> during his tenure as <a href="/wiki/Mayor_of_Davao_City" title="Mayor of Davao City">Mayor of Davao City</a> and as <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_Philippines" title="President of the Philippines">President of the Philippines</a>, until the country's withdrawal from the <a href="/wiki/Rome_Statute" title="Rome Statute">Rome Statute</a> in 2019. He is the fifth Philippine president to be indicted and arrested, following <a href="/wiki/Emilio_Aguinaldo" title="Emilio Aguinaldo">Emilio Aguinaldo</a> (<a href="/wiki/Emilio_Aguinaldo#Capture,_investigation_and_acquittal" title="Emilio Aguinaldo">1945</a>), <a href="/wiki/Jose_P._Laurel" title="Jose P.

He is also the first Philippine president to face an international tribunal and the first leader from <a href="/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a> to face trial before the ICC.

Analysts have described Duterte's arrest and surrender to the ICC as remarkably quick and trouble-free, as well as a "seismic" precedent-setting event that could inform how other criminally charged world leaders would potentially be arrested.

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Launch_of_the_ICC_investigation">Launch of the ICC investigation</h3></div>

<p>Rodrigo Duterte was investigated by the <a href="/wiki/International_Criminal_Court" title="International Criminal Court">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) for alleged <a href="/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity" title="Crimes against humanity">crimes against humanity</a>. The investigation covered Duterte's links to the <a href="/wiki/Davao_Death_Squad" title="Davao Death Squad">Davao Death Squad</a>, which is estimated to have killed at least a thousand people since the 1990s, as well as reports of extrajudicial killings of alleged drug dealers and users during his presidency, limited to the period before the Philippines withdrew from the ICC in 2019.
</p><p>In 2017, Filipino lawyer Jude Sabio submitted a 77-page document to the ICC titled "The Situation of Mass Murder in the Philippines", accusing President Duterte and 11 other officials of <a href="/wiki/Mass_murder" title="Mass murder">mass murder</a> and crimes against humanity. Similarly, then-senator <a href="/wiki/Antonio_Trillanes" title="Antonio Trillanes">Antonio Trillanes</a> and members of the <a href="/wiki/Magdalo_Party-List" title="Magdalo Party-List">Magdalo Party-List</a>, led by then-representative Gary Alejano, filed a 45-page supplemental complaint requesting charges of crimes against humanity, supporting Sabio's earlier filing.
</p><p>The ICC's jurisdiction in the Philippines applies only to the period when the country was a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/State_party_to_the_Rome_Statute" title="State party to the Rome Statute">state party to the Rome Statute</a> (November 1, 2011 – March 16, 2019). This includes nearly three years of Duterte's presidency, during which the Philippine drug war was at its peak. The <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_Philippines" title="Supreme Court of the Philippines">Supreme Court of the Philippines</a>, in a 2021 ruling, commented on the withdrawal from the Rome Statute and stated that the Philippines still has an obligation to cooperate in the ICC proceedings.

<link href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1236090951" rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style"/>
<p>Under President <a href="/wiki/Bongbong_Marcos" title="Bongbong Marcos">Bongbong Marcos</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Presidency_of_Bongbong_Marcos" title="Presidency of Bongbong Marcos">administration</a>, the government maintained its stance of non-cooperation with the ICC investigation. However, by 2024, it acknowledged that it could not prevent investigators from acting independently. In November 2024, the Philippine government reaffirmed its stance on the ICC but stated that it would surrender Duterte if he were indicted, citing its obligation to <a href="/wiki/Interpol" title="Interpol">Interpol</a>.
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Preparation_for_Duterte's_arrest"><span id="Preparation_for_Duterte.27s_arrest"></span>Preparation for Duterte's arrest</h3></div>
<p>In May 2024, the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Justice_(Philippines)" title="Department of Justice (Philippines)">Department of Justice</a> began briefing President Marcos on the possible scenarios in ICC issuing a warrant of arrest for Duterte, as well as its legal team's preparations for how to handle it.
</p><p>According to <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i>, in preparation for the possible issuance of an arrest warrant by the ICC, the <a href="/wiki/Philippine_National_Police" title="Philippine National Police">Philippine National Police</a> (PNP) had discreetly prepared an 80-page plan for Duterte's arrest with the code name Operation Pursuit. In it, they laid out scenarios for how the arrest of Duterte might play out in either Manila or <a href="/wiki/Davao_City" title="Davao City">Davao City</a>, with maps of Duterte's properties as well as his allies' properties included in the document. PNP police general <a href="/wiki/Nicolas_Torre" title="Nicolas Torre">Nicolas Torre</a> himself later admitted to planning the entire operation once it was entrusted to him, stating that "I really told them that let me[...] succeed and fail on my plans. Because if I succeed, I succeed based on my plans. If I fail, I fail on my plans also, so there's no one else to blame but me."

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Prelude_to_arrest">Prelude to arrest</h2></div>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Issuance_of_warrant">Issuance of warrant</h3></div>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/International_Criminal_Court" title="International Criminal Court">International Criminal Court</a>'s (ICC) Pre-Trial Chamber I issued a warrant on March 7, 2025, at <a href="/wiki/The_Hague" title="The Hague">The Hague</a>, with Judges <a href="/wiki/Iulia_Motoc" title="Iulia Motoc">Iulia Motoc</a>, <a href="/wiki/Reine_Alapini-Gansou" title="Reine Alapini-Gansou">Reine Alapini-Gansou</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Socorro_Flores_Liera" title="Socorro Flores Liera">Socorro Flores Liera</a> presiding. The ICC reached out to <a href="/wiki/Interpol" title="Interpol">Interpol</a> for the execution of the warrant. While rumors suggested that a warrant was imminent as Duterte flew to Hong Kong a few days prior, its legal existence was not immediately disclosed to the public. The document was reclassified from "secret" to "public" on March 11. The <a href="/wiki/Presidential_Communications_Office" title="Presidential Communications Office">Presidential Communications Office</a> confirmed the warrant in a press release hours after its execution.
</p><p>In a press conference shortly after the plane bound for the Netherlands departed, President <a href="/wiki/Bongbong_Marcos" title="Bongbong Marcos">Bongbong Marcos</a> stated the warrant had been sent to the <a href="/wiki/Office_of_the_President_of_the_Philippines" title="Office of the President of the Philippines">Office of the President of the Philippines</a> via the Interpol Manila office at around 03:00 <a href="/wiki/Philippine_Standard_Time" title="Philippine Standard Time">PHT</a> (<a href="/wiki/UTC%2B08:00" title="UTC+08:00">UTC+08:00</a>) on March 11, 2025. He added that authorities proceeded with serving the warrant in coordination with the <a href="/wiki/Philippine_National_Police" title="Philippine National Police">Philippine National Police</a> (PNP). He emphasized that the PNP enforced the warrant in coordination with Interpol, not the ICC, of which the Philippines was formerly a member.
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Hong_Kong_PDP_rally">Hong Kong PDP rally</h3></div>
<p>On the morning of March 7, Rodrigo Duterte flew to <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> with his common-law wife, <a href="/wiki/Honeylet_Avance%C3%B1a" title="Honeylet Avanceña">Honeylet Avanceña</a>; their daughter, Veronica "Kitty" Duterte; their adoptive daughter, Mira; his former executive secretary, <a href="/wiki/Salvador_Medialdea" title="Salvador Medialdea">Salvador Medialdea</a>; and his entourage. They had initially traveled from <a href="/wiki/Davao_City" title="Davao City">Davao City</a> to <a href="/wiki/Manila" title="Manila">Manila</a> the previous evening. His eldest daughter, Vice President <a href="/wiki/Sara_Duterte" title="Sara Duterte">Sara Duterte</a>, flew to Hong Kong later on to join him. Duterte had already heard about the imminent arrest warrant from the ICC, and while in Hong Kong, he and his family debated whether to remain in Chinese territory or return to the Philippines.
</p><p>On March 8, the Hong Kong-based newspaper <i><a href="/wiki/The_Standard_(Hong_Kong)" title="The Standard (Hong Kong)">The Standard</a></i> first reported Duterte's presence in the city after he was spotted in <a href="/wiki/Causeway_Bay" title="Causeway Bay">Causeway Bay</a> with his entourage, amid circulating rumors that the ICC had issued an arrest warrant for him. <a href="/wiki/Salvador_Panelo" title="Salvador Panelo">Salvador Panelo</a>, Duterte's former presidential legal counsel, stated that his trip was solely to thank supporters in Hong Kong at a <a href="/wiki/Partido_Demokratiko_Pilipino" title="Partido Demokratiko Pilipino">Partido Demokratiko Pilipino</a> (PDP) campaign sortie. He added that he would join Duterte the following day. The Philippine government did not confirm at the time whether the ICC had issued an arrest warrant but stated, "If Interpol will ask the necessary assistance from the government, it is obliged to follow" and that "the government is prepared in any eventuality".
</p><p>On March 9, Duterte attended a PDP campaign sortie organized by the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Jesus_Christ_(church)" title="Kingdom of Jesus Christ (church)">Kingdom of Jesus Christ</a> (KOJC) at the <a href="/wiki/Southorn_Playground" title="Southorn Playground">Southorn Stadium</a> in <a href="/wiki/Wan_Chai" title="Wan Chai">Wan Chai</a>, where he promoted his party's slate of senatorial candidates. Others who attended the sortie include Vice President Sara Duterte and Senators <a href="/wiki/Bong_Go" title="Bong Go">Bong Go</a> and <a href="/wiki/Robin_Padilla" title="Robin Padilla">Robin Padilla</a>, as well as senatorial candidates <a href="/wiki/Vic_Rodriguez_(lawyer)" title="Vic Rodriguez (lawyer)">Vic Rodriguez</a>, <a href="/wiki/Raul_Lambino" title="Raul Lambino">Raul Lambino</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rodante_Marcoleta" title="Rodante Marcoleta">Rodante Marcoleta</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Bondoc" title="Jimmy Bondoc">Jimmy Bondoc</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Phillip_Salvador" title="Phillip Salvador">Phillip Salvador</a>. Senator <a href="/wiki/Ronald_dela_Rosa" title="Ronald dela Rosa">Ronald dela Rosa</a> was expected to attend but was unable to, while a standee for jailed pastor and KOJC founder <a href="/wiki/Apollo_Quiboloy" title="Apollo Quiboloy">Apollo Quiboloy</a>, a senatorial candidate, was displayed on the campaign stage. Most of the attendees were female <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Overseas_Filipino_workers" title="Overseas Filipino workers">overseas Filipino workers</a> (OFWs). In his speech, Duterte acknowledged the rumored arrest warrant, expressing both defiance toward the ICC and readiness to face arrest. Jokingly, he added that the crowd could contribute "$5 or $10" each to fund a monument of himself beside a <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Rizal" title="José Rizal">José Rizal</a> statue in <a href="/wiki/Davao_City" title="Davao City">Davao City</a>.
</p><p>From March 10 to the morning of March 11, hundreds of police officers were deployed at <a href="/wiki/Francisco_Bangoy_International_Airport" title="Francisco Bangoy International Airport">Francisco Bangoy International Airport</a> in Davao City, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Clark_Freeport_Zone" title="Clark Freeport Zone">Clark Freeport Zone</a> in <a href="/wiki/Pampanga" title="Pampanga">Pampanga</a>, and Metro Manila. <i><a href="/wiki/The_Manila_Times" title="The Manila Times">The Manila Times</a></i> reported that this was in preparation for the possible arrest of a high-profile but unidentified individual, widely speculated to be Duterte, who was set to return to the Philippines from Hong Kong. Prior to Duterte's return to the Philippines, his group had booked five separate flights back to the country in order to confuse authorities upon arrival.
</p><p>Rumors circulated that Duterte had sought political asylum in China. However, Sara Duterte stated that her father had not been in contact with Chinese officials during his stay.
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Operation_Pursuit">Operation Pursuit</h2></div>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Arrest">Arrest</h3></div>
<p>On March 11, more than 300 police officers, led by <a href="/wiki/Philippine_National_Police" title="Philippine National Police">Philippine National Police</a> (PNP) chief <a href="/wiki/Rommel_Marbil" title="Rommel Marbil">Rommel Marbil</a> and <a href="/wiki/Criminal_Investigation_and_Detection_Group" title="Criminal Investigation and Detection Group">Criminal Investigation and Detection Group</a> director <a href="/wiki/Nicolas_Torre" title="Nicolas Torre">Nicolas Torre</a>, were deployed at <a href="/wiki/Ninoy_Aquino_International_Airport" title="Ninoy Aquino International Airport">Ninoy Aquino International Airport</a> (NAIA) Terminal 3 in anticipation of Duterte's arrival from Hong Kong. At 09:20 PHT (UTC+08:00), Duterte arrived at NAIA on <a href="/wiki/Cathay_Pacific" title="Cathay Pacific">Cathay Pacific</a> Flight 907. While Duterte was waiting for his wheelchair, retired general <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Alcantara" title="Anthony Alcantara">Anthony Alcantara</a>, executive director of the Philippine Center on Transnational Crimes, met him on the plane, informed him of the ICC-issued warrant and escorted him to the <a href="/wiki/Jet_bridge" title="Jet bridge">jet bridge</a>. There, Alcantara, <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Justice_(Philippines)" title="Department of Justice (Philippines)">Department of Justice</a> prosecutor general Richard Fadullon and Special Envoy on Transnational Crime Markus Lacanilao (Interpol's representative) arrested him with the support of PNP officers. The reading of <a href="/wiki/Right_to_silence#Philippines" title="Right to silence">Miranda rights</a> was postponed at the request of Duterte's party, which insisted that they be read only in a more secure location so that Duterte would not be taken into custody. Lawyers <a href="/wiki/Salvador_Medialdea" title="Salvador Medialdea">Salvador Medialdea</a> and his wife, Maria Bertola "Betty" D. Medialdea, both former cabinet officials during Duterte's presidency, were present during his arrest. Duterte's daughter, Kitty, livestreamed his arrest, while his common-law wife, Avanceña, tried to dissuade him from complying with police authorities, calling them "abusive" and claiming they had no warrant.
</p><p>Aside from the Medialdeas, Duterte's other lawyers, aides, and doctors were prevented from approaching him when he was taken into police custody. Senator Go, who arrived separately from Duterte, and lawyer <a href="/wiki/Silvestre_Bello_III" title="Silvestre Bello III">Silvestre Bello III</a> informed the media at the airport about Duterte's detention and separation from his aides.
</p><p>Go stated that police denied his request to see Duterte despite his claim that an ambulance was already waiting for Duterte's planned medical checkup. According to Torre and former senator <a href="/wiki/Antonio_Trillanes" title="Antonio Trillanes">Antonio Trillanes</a>, however, Duterte had a private jet already waiting for him at NAIA when he arrived. Most of the police officers escorting Duterte out of the airport were women, per a request from Interior Secretary <a href="/wiki/Jonvic_Remulla" title="Jonvic Remulla">Jonvic Remulla</a>, who anticipated potential outbursts from Duterte against male officers.
</p><p>The PNP later placed its regional units and national support on heightened alert, starting March 11, in anticipation of potential protests and civil disturbances following Duterte's arrest.
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Detention_and_transfer_to_The_Hague">Detention and transfer to The Hague</h3></div>
<p>Following his arrest, Duterte was taken to <a href="/wiki/Villamor_Air_Base" title="Villamor Air Base">Villamor Air Base</a>, where he and his family were housed in Maharlika Hall within the 250th Presidential Airlift Wing. They were joined by the Medialdea couple, lawyer <a href="/wiki/Martin_Delgra_III" title="Martin Delgra III">Martin Delgra III</a>, retired general Filmore B. Escobal and former <a href="/wiki/National_Intelligence_Coordinating_Agency" title="National Intelligence Coordinating Agency">NICA</a> director Alex Paul Monteagudo. During his detention, Duterte was allowed to sleep in a room next to the hall. Torre read Duterte his Miranda rights and presented a printed copy of the arrest warrant. Despite Torre's repeated insistence, Duterte refused to comply with the booking procedure. Senator Go arrived at Villamor with former government officials Bello, <a href="/wiki/Lorraine_Badoy-Partosa" title="Lorraine Badoy-Partosa">Lorraine Badoy-Partosa</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Trixie_Cruz-Angeles" title="Trixie Cruz-Angeles">Trixie Cruz-Angeles</a>, but was denied entry to the air base.
</p><p>Duterte's standoff with PNP officials over his refusal to leave for <a href="/wiki/The_Hague" title="The Hague">The Hague</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> lasted approximately 12 hours. During an attempt to separate Duterte from his family, his daughter Kitty tried to push through a group of police officers to reach his room. Avanceña then struck a <a href="/wiki/Special_Action_Force" title="Special Action Force">SAF</a> officer on the head with her smartphone, allegedly in response to being separated from her daughter. The SAF officer was later hospitalized but soon recovered. Towards the end of the standoff, Duterte's legal counsel, Salvador Medialdea, attempted to block the PNP from escorting Duterte to a <a href="/wiki/Minibus" title="Minibus">coaster</a> bound for a jet headed to the Netherlands at Villamor. When Medialdea challenged Torre to detain him, Torre briefly handcuffed him for obstruction of justice and read him his Miranda rights. Medialdea soon acquiesced, and when Torre made moves to arrest Delgra as well, Duterte submitted and boarded the coaster to the jet.
</p><p>In later interviews, Torre stated that the PNP accommodated nearly all of Duterte's requests, including food, medical attention, and legal counsel, except for his request not to be taken to The Hague. When Torre asked Avanceña for Duterte's medical conditions, prescribed medicines and possible list of allergies, she declined to answer. According to Torre and PNP spokesperson Jean Fajardo, the PNP exercised "maximum tolerance" throughout Duterte's arrest and detention, prohibiting officers from making physical contact with him and instructing them not to retaliate against any verbal or physical assault from his party.
</p><p>For the Philippine government, the process of securing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Flight_permits" title="Flight permits">flight permits</a> from other countries for Duterte's chartered plane was a difficult task. Some countries such as <a href="/wiki/Vietnam" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oman" title="Oman">Oman</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates" title="United Arab Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a> took hours before they responded to the request, with the latter two having shortened their working hours in accordance with <a href="/wiki/Ramadan" title="Ramadan">Ramadan</a>.
</p><p>On <a href="/wiki/Facebook" title="Facebook">Facebook</a>, lawyer and PDP senatorial candidate <a href="/wiki/Raul_Lambino" title="Raul Lambino">Raul Lambino</a> falsely claimed that a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Temporary_restraining_order" title="Temporary restraining order">temporary restraining order</a> (TRO) had been issued by the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_Philippines" title="Supreme Court of the Philippines">Supreme Court</a> for police authorities, which would have prevented them from bringing Duterte to The Hague. KOJC lawyer Israelito Torreon went to the court at night with Lambino to allegedly confirm the TRO's issuance and receive the hard copy. Although he later recanted his claim, Lambino was soon disparaged by lawmakers for spreading false information, with the Supreme Court itself stating that it will investigate how the false TRO claim had spread.
</p><p>After a delay of a few hours due to revisions in the <a href="/wiki/Manifest_(transportation)" title="Manifest (transportation)">manifest</a> (Avanceña declined to join Duterte, allegedly citing a lack of a <a href="/wiki/Philippine_passport" title="Philippine passport">passport</a> despite having traveled to Hong Kong with him), a government-chartered <a href="/wiki/Gulfstream_G550" title="Gulfstream G550">Gulfstream G550</a> jet departed Manila at 23:03 PHT (UTC+08:00) carrying Duterte, his legal counsel Medialdea, and his party. The jet, leased from the <a href="/wiki/Office_of_the_President_of_the_Philippines" title="Office of the President of the Philippines">Office of the President of the Philippines</a>, made a layover at <a href="/wiki/Al_Maktoum_International_Airport" title="Al Maktoum International Airport">Al Maktoum International Airport</a> in the United Arab Emirates before landing at <a href="/wiki/Rotterdam_The_Hague_Airport" title="Rotterdam The Hague Airport">Rotterdam The Hague Airport</a> in the Netherlands at 4:54 p.m. local time the next day.
</p><p>President <a href="/wiki/Bongbong_Marcos" title="Bongbong Marcos">Bongbong Marcos</a> held a press conference minutes after Duterte's plane departed Villamor Air Base, clarifying that the arrest was carried out not on behalf of the ICC (which the Philippines is not a member of), but in cooperation with <a href="/wiki/Interpol" title="Interpol">Interpol</a>. Marcos emphasized that the Philippines, as part of the international community, must uphold its commitments and responsibilities.
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Protests_and_mass_actions">Protests and mass actions</h2></div>
<p>Widespread protests and mass actions, both in support of and against Duterte, were held across the Philippines and abroad following his arrest.

<p><a href="/wiki/Salvador_Panelo" title="Salvador Panelo">Salvador Panelo</a>, the former chief presidential legal counsel and presidential spokesperson of Rodrigo Duterte, lambasted Duterte's arrest as unlawful, stating that the Philippines was no longer a member of the ICC. The <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_Philippines" title="Supreme Court of the Philippines">Supreme Court</a>, to which he is answerable as an "officer of the court", had previously ruled that the country remained obliged to cooperate with the ICC regarding events leading up to its withdrawal.
</p><p>Duterte's daughter, Philippine Vice President <a href="/wiki/Sara_Duterte" title="Sara Duterte">Sara Duterte</a>, criticized the Philippine government while announcing that her father would be flown to the International Criminal Court. In her statement, she considered her father's detention to be "a blatant affront to our sovereignty and an insult to every Filipino who believes in our nation's independence". She labeled his arrest as "<a href="/wiki/Political_kidnapping" title="Political kidnapping">state kidnapping</a>". While on a flight to the Netherlands on March 12, Vice President Duterte changed her <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Profile_picture#social_media" title="Profile picture">profile pictures</a> on <a href="/wiki/Facebook" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> and <a href="/wiki/Twitter" title="Twitter">X</a> to a digital red ribbon containing the text "BRING PRRD HOME 👊🏻".
</p><p>Duterte's son and Davao City mayor <a href="/wiki/Sebastian_Duterte" title="Sebastian Duterte">Sebastian Duterte</a> alleged on Facebook that his father was being denied medical care while in custody and that the government was trying to get him to board a plane without disclosing the destination. The Philippine government maintained that Duterte was in good condition.
</p><p>On March 14, 2025, Sara Duterte publicly disclosed that she would not return to the Philippines for an unspecified period, stating that she would focus on forming her father's legal team. The next day, Sara stated that she would not return to her country until another family relative arrived in the Netherlands to accompany her father. On April 7, 2025, she returned to the Philippines.
</p><p>Sebastian Duterte has alleged that search warrants have been issued for the residences of his father and other members of the Duterte family, which the PNP has denied. In a statement in the Netherlands on March 16, Sara Duterte stated that she expected evidence against her family to be <a href="/wiki/False_evidence#Types" title="False evidence">planted</a> during a police search.
</p><p>Former presidential spokesperson <a href="/wiki/Harry_Roque" title="Harry Roque">Harry Roque</a>, who is seeking recognition as legal counsel for Rodrigo Duterte at the ICC, reiterated Duterte's wish to be tried in the Philippines in a Facebook post.

<p>During a press conference held minutes after Duterte's plane departed for the Netherlands, President <a href="/wiki/Bongbong_Marcos" title="Bongbong Marcos">Bongbong Marcos</a> denied allegations that Duterte's arrest was "political persecution", stating that the case had been initiated in 2017 while Duterte was president.

</p><p>Duterte's arrest drew mixed reactions from majority bloc members of the Senate.

House Deputy Majority Leader and <a href="/wiki/La_Union%27s_1st_congressional_district" title="La Union's 1st congressional district">La Union 1st District</a> Representative Paolo Ortega described Duterte's arrest as a "significant step" toward delivering long-awaited justice to the victims of extrajudicial killings, urging Duterte to face his criminal charges instead of portraying himself as a victim.
