</p><p>In 2017, Noman became the finance secretary of the city of Belo Horizonte with Kalil as mayor.

After Kalil resigned in 2022 to <a href="/wiki/2022_Minas_Gerais_gubernatorial_election" title="2022 Minas Gerais gubernatorial election">run for governor</a>, Noman became mayor.

</p><p>Noman's administration marked a shift away from the policies adopted by the prior Kalil administration, which led to tensions with municipal advisors appointed by Kalil. Among his administration's more notable actions was the reduction of the value paid by the municipality towards the granting of right to build permits in the city, which had been instituted by the municipal administrator of the city master plan after having been approved by the Kalil administration. The policy led to the reduction of payments made towards new buildings along the Avenida do Contorno, one of the main arterial roads in downtown Belo Horizonte, by half. The change in policy ran against studies made by Noman's administration itself, but after pressure from lobbying groups such as <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=FIEMG&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="FIEMG (page does not exist)">FIEMG</a>, however, the policy was maintained, approved, and sanctioned.
