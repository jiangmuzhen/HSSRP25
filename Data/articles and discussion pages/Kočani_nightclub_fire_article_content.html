<p>On 16 March 2025, a fire at the Pulse <a href="/wiki/Nightclub" title="Nightclub">nightclub</a> in <a href="/wiki/Ko%C4%8Dani" title="Kočani">Kočani</a>, North Macedonia, killed 62 people and injured 193. The fire started when sparks from indoor fireworks hit the ceiling and set it alight, rapidly enveloping the venue in thick and toxic smoke. The nightclub was unlicensed and broke numerous safety standards: among other things, it lacked sprinklers, sufficient emergency exits, and only had a single fire extinguisher. Rescue efforts were hampered by the nightclub's location in a densely populated neighborhood, which caused firetrucks difficulty in reaching it. 
</p><p>Local hospitals were severely ill-equipped to deal with the influx of victims, with some left lying in the street due to a insufficient number of ambulances. Many of them suffered severe burns, <a href="/wiki/Smoke_inhalation" title="Smoke inhalation">smoke inhalation</a>, and crush injuries after the crowd rushed for the exits. In response to the fire, the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> (EU) activated its Civil Defense Mechanism to coordinate the air evacuation of victims, many of whom were transported for treatment in EU member states.
</p><p>As of March 2025, it is the deadliest nightclub fire in Europe since the 2015 <a href="/wiki/Colectiv_nightclub_fire" title="Colectiv nightclub fire">Bucharest nightclub fire</a> and the deadliest fire in <a href="/wiki/North_Macedonia" title="North Macedonia">North Macedonia</a>'s history. The government ordered a three-day inspection of all nightclubs and cabarets in the country and many entertainment venues were shut down. Government officials, including several ministers and police officers, were arrested as part of the investigation into how the nightclub was given a license. Vigils and tributes were organised nationwide. In the aftermath of the disaster there were numerous anti-corruption protests.

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Background">Background</h2></div>
<p>The nightclub was situated in a building formerly used as a carpet warehouse. It was described as an "improvised nightclub" by local reporters and, according to authorities, did not have a legal license to operate, but had been doing so for several years before the fire. According to interior minister <a href="/wiki/Pan%C4%8De_To%C5%A1kovski" title="Panče Toškovski">Panče Toškovski</a>, the building was only certified for <a href="/wiki/Light_industry" title="Light industry">light industry</a> and not for catering. One resident of Kočani, who had worked there 20 years prior when it housed a textile factory, expressed confusion that such a small building could fit 500 people, and said that it had "very low ceilings".
</p><p>An inspection after the fire revealed deficiencies in the building's fire-extinguishing and lighting systems. Additionally, only one effective exit was identified in the building, because the venue's back door was locked. Apart from being locked, the back door did not have a handle on the inside, was covered with <a href="/wiki/Drywall" title="Drywall">drywall</a>, and was lined with flammable soundproofing materials. The building was made of flammable drywall, had no fire alarms, and only a single fire extinguisher. The building did not have a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trip_switch" title="Trip switch">trip switch</a>.

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Fire">Fire</h2></div>
<p>At 2:35 am on 16 March 2025, about 650 people were attending a concert of Macedonian <a href="/wiki/Hip-hop" title="Hip-hop">hip-hop</a> duo <a href="/wiki/DNK_(duo)" title="DNK (duo)">DNK</a> in the Pulse Nightclub, although only 250 tickets were sold. The club was filled with twice of its legal capacity. Perpendicular sparkling <a href="/wiki/Gerb_(pyrotechnic)" title="Gerb (pyrotechnic)">gerbs</a>, a type of indoor firework, were lit by DNK during their performance at approximately 2:32 am. Their sparks ignited flammable acoustic foam sheets that burned across the roof structure, rapidly engulfing the entire venue in flames and toxic smoke.

<p>Videos of the pyrotechnics and subsequent fire showed attempts to extinguish the flames, with some patrons observing the firefighting while others evacuated. One survivor said that she shouted at a group of children to leave the disco, but they laughed at her. Survivors reported a <a href="/wiki/Crowd_collapses_and_crushes" title="Crowd collapses and crushes">crowd crush</a> when people rushed towards the club exits, and some victims were trampled to death while trying to escape the club. One survivor described being trampled by the crowd after falling down the stairs. A band member urged the crowd to evacuate during the firefighting, stating: "Everyone get out, we'll be back". Some of the victims attempted to escape through the club's bathroom, but were met with barred windows. A 19-year-old, Jovan Kostadinov, rescued 21 people from the club.
</p><p>The first call to emergency services was received at 2:48 am. Fire crews from nearby cities were also deployed. The rescue efforts were hampered by the inability of firetrucks to access the nightclub, as it was located in a densely populated neighborhood. Authorities rushed dozens of injured people to nearby hospitals in <a href="/wiki/%C5%A0tip" title="Štip">Štip</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ko%C4%8Dani" title="Kočani">Kočani</a> and <a href="/wiki/Skopje" title="Skopje">Skopje</a>.

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Casualties">Casualties</h2></div>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Deaths">Deaths</h3></div>
<p>At least 62 people aged between 16 and 48, died from the fire, with six of the victims being minors. This was the deadliest nightclub fire in Europe since the 2015 <a href="/wiki/Colectiv_nightclub_fire" title="Colectiv nightclub fire">Bucharest nightclub fire</a> (also caused by pyrotechnics), and the deadliest fire in North Macedonia's history. A hospital director in Kočani, Kristina Serafimovska, said most of the dead suffered injuries from the stampede of people trying to escape the club, but the Director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine, Aleksandar Stankov, said that the majority of the victims died of <a href="/wiki/Asphyxia" title="Asphyxia">asphyxia</a>. Many victims were difficult to identify due to their lack of identification cards, with only half of them possessing identity documents. An ambulance driver in Kočani, Ile Gocevski, who was transporting victims to the hospital throughout the day, died in his sleep on 17 March, a day after the fire, after he had returned home to rest. He died of a heart attack caused by overexertion after completing 11 hospital runs overnight. One of his colleagues wrote a social media post calling Macedonian ambulance drivers overworked and underpaid and praising Gocevski's actions. Macedonian Minister of Health <a href="/wiki/Arben_Taravari" title="Arben Taravari">Arben Taravari</a> responded to the post, pledging to improve the working conditions and pay of ambulance drivers, and said that their work is often overlooked.
</p><p><a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Andreja_Gjorgjieski&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Andreja Gjorgjieski (page does not exist)">Andreja Gjorgjieski</a>, one of DNK's lead singers, was confirmed dead along with the band's photographer Aleksandar Efremov, backing singer Sara Projkovska, drummer Gjorgji Gjorgiev and keyboard player Filip Stevanovski. Two other band members survived the initial fire, but died later in the afternoon. Vladimir Blažev, the other lead singer, suffered burns to his face and hands and was provided with oxygen therapy; he was the only survivor from DNK. Shortly after the fire, rumors spread on social media that Gjorgjieski was alive and receiving treatment at his home, but his wife denied them and requested that social media outlets refrain from posting misinformation and for her and her family's privacy to be respected. Per witnesses and his manager, Gjorgjieski returned to rescue the people inside the club, and died when the roof collapsed upon him, killing him instantly. Another backing singer, Ana Kostadinovska, was injured in the fire and received treatment at her home; she was initially reported missing.
</p><p>A police officer at the club checking for drugs and minors died as a result of the fire. <a href="/wiki/KF_Shkupi" title="KF Shkupi">KF Shkupi</a> football player <a href="/wiki/Andrej_Lazarov" title="Andrej Lazarov">Andrej Lazarov</a> suffered from smoke inhalation and burn injuries while trying to rescue club patrons, and died a short time after in the hospital. Lazarov's mother said that he suffocated after falling off a bench in a hospital in Štip while waiting for treatment. Damjan Taneski, a young football goalkeeper from Štip, and Petar Ivanovski, a basketball player for Basket Dino Delicacies from Kočani, were also among the victims of the fire.
</p><p>Parents of some of the victims claimed that hospitals did not provide adequate medical attention to their children, leading to their deaths. A mother of a victim said that she was informed that her daughter was being treated in Skopje, but when her and her family arrived there, they were told that she was actually in a hospital in Kočani. They were blocked from entering the room by the police, and later learned of her death. According to the mother, oxygen had likely not been administered to her daughter, even though she was in critical condition, since the Kočani hospital did not have any supply of medicinal oxygen.
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Injuries">Injuries</h3></div>
<p>193 people were injured, including 20 minors. At least 72 people were hospitalised within North Macedonia, while 101 others were confirmed to have been taken abroad for treatment. Some of those were hospitalized in hospitals of Kočani and <a href="/wiki/%C5%A0tip" title="Štip">Štip</a>. Beside those, some were transported to the hospitals of Skopje. This includes 17 with severe burns who were taken to the St. Naum of Ohrid hospital, 49 to the Clinical Centre of Skopje, and 18 to the September 8 General Hospital, two of whom were in critical condition. The Kočani regional hospital was severely unequipped for the influx of victims, having only two ambulances and one van with a bed. <i>Radio Kočani</i> reported that the injured were left lying in the street, since there were not enough emergency vehicles to transport them all. Some of the victims were transported to the hospital by civilian bystanders. A brother of one of the victims said that there were corpses in the hospital corridors, and that he had to step over them to check on his injured sister.
</p><p>Due to the severity of the injuries as a result of burns and <a href="/wiki/Smoke_inhalation" title="Smoke inhalation">smoke inhalation</a>, some of the injured were transferred to specialized units at hospitals and clinics in Skopje and Štip. By 17 March, all of the remaining patients at the Kočani general hospital had been transferred to clinics in Skopje. Since the drywall installed on the ceiling of the nightclub contained <a href="/wiki/Asbestos" title="Asbestos">asbestos</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Carcinogen" title="Carcinogen">carcinogen</a>, Minister of Health Taravari instructed the injured and anyone else who was at the scene of the fire to see a doctor because they may have inhaled the asbestos.

Vučić was photographed touching a patient with his bare hands, and later took off his <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Medical_mask" title="Medical mask">medical mask</a> while speaking to the press in front of a patient.

<p>The funerals of the victims were held on 20 March in Štip, Kočani, and <a href="/wiki/Oble%C5%A1evo,_North_Macedonia" title="Obleševo, North Macedonia">Obleševo</a>. The funeral in Kočani was officiated by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stefan,_Archbishop_of_Ohrid_and_Macedonia" title="Stefan, Archbishop of Ohrid and Macedonia">Stefan, Archbishop of Ohrid and Macedonia</a>, the head of the <a href="/wiki/Macedonian_Orthodox_Church" title="Macedonian Orthodox Church">Macedonian Orthodox Church</a>, and was restricted to the relatives of the victims. The beginning of the ceremony was briefly interrupted after some mourners fainted. Among the deceased members of DNK, Gjorgjieski was buried in the <a href="/wiki/Butel" title="Butel">Butel</a> municipal cemetery, Projkovska in <a href="/wiki/Gorno_Lisi%C4%8De" title="Gorno Lisiče">Gorno Lisiče</a>, Gjorgiev in Strumica, while Stevanovski, Kolarov and Efremov were buried in Štip.
</p><p>The Agency for Audio and Audiovisual Media Services requested that the media "adhere to the highest professional and ethical standards" while reporting on the funerals and said that media should refrain from taking pictures of the graves or violating mourners' privacy. The North Macedonian government condemned unnamed foreign media outlets whom they alleged "crossed every line of humanity and dignity in reporting on the tragic funeral in Kočani". The Independent Journalists' Association of Serbia (NUNS) condemned the usage of footage of "graves, close family members, and private moments" of the victims by the Serbian media outlets <i>Republika</i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Kurir" title="Kurir">Kurir</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Blic" title="Blic">Blic</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Alo!" title="Alo!">Alo!</a></i>, <i>Telegraf,</i> and <i>Mondo</i>, and requested that the Serbian <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Information_and_Telecommunications_(Serbia)" title="Ministry of Information and Telecommunications (Serbia)">Ministry of Information and Telecommunications</a> take action. NUNS said that the coverage was a violation of the Serbian Journalists' Code of Ethics, which forbids "reporting on funerals of private individuals", and that such coverage "is not in the public interest". The Ministry of Information and Telecommunications condemned the footage in a statement, and publicly ordered the aforementioned media outlets to immediately remove it from their websites, saying that the media outlets "violated the dignity of the victims, caused anxiety among their relatives and the entire public, and demonstrated a lack of awareness of the need to respect elementary professional standards".

<div class="mw-heading mw-heading2"><h2 id="Investigation">Investigation</h2></div>
<p>North Macedonia's Interior Minister, <a href="/wiki/Pan%C4%8De_To%C5%A1kovski" title="Panče Toškovski">Panče Toškovski</a> said that the nightclub's operating license was obtained as a result of corruption and bribery. Later reports simply referred to the nightclub as unlicensed. Toškovski said that the homes of two former Ministry of Economy employees were searched, and technical equipment, documentation, weapons, ammunition were seized. On 18 March, Toškovski said that local police from Štip and Veles that were investigating the fire would be replaced with officers from Skopje, to ensure that "process proceeds without pressure, suspicion, or undue influence", but added that the decision does not "imply guilt" upon the local police officers. The government ordered a three-day inspection of all nightclubs and cabarets in the country. An inspection found significant safety violations at the Pulse Nightclub:
</p>
<ul><li>The venue lacked basic fire safety equipment, including sufficient fire extinguishers and a functional fire alarm system.</li>
<li>The club had only one accessible exit, as the back door was locked, severely hindering evacuation efforts during the fire.</li>
<li>The building had undergone unauthorized modifications, including the use of illegal soundproofing materials, which may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire.</li></ul>
<p>At a press conference on 17 March, Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski announced that only 12 legal licenses for nightclubs had been issued throughout the country, and the Pulse Nightclub was not one of them. Just one day later, the government spokesperson announced that there were in fact 22 legal licenses, out of 50 inspected establishments. A further 15 of the 50 did not have licenses or had expired licenses. As a result, many nightclubs and entertainment venues were shut down. Three licensed nightclubs were closed down and their licenses were revoked after investigations found numerous deficiencies. Police visited all 12 companies in North Macedonia that are licensed to handle pyrotechnics. On 20 March, the state public prosecutor, Ljupčo Kocevski, said there is an ongoing investigation into "bribery, illegalities in the procurement of pyrotechnics, and several other crimes".

<p>As of 13 April 2025, 52 people and three companies have been placed under investigation over the fire. At least 34 people have been identified as suspects, with 27 people and three entities being criminally investigated. Former Ministry of Economy State Secretary Razmena Čekić Đurović was arrested after investigators discovered she signed the forged license the nightclub was operating under. Authorities confirmed that the Pulse Nightclub's license document was not found in the government's license database, even though it was issued on official government stationery and was signed by employees of the Ministry of Economy. The owner of the nightclub, Dejan Jovanov, was arrested, as were his son, wife, and daughter. Jovanov's residence, vehicle, and businesses were searched by police, and electronic devices and "documentation" found in his home were seized.
</p><p>On 20 March, seven police officers were arrested for having allegedly "prepared, signed, and approved" a consent form for the nightclub to obtain a catering license, even though the club did not meet the minimum requirements to do so.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Union_for_Integration" title="Democratic Union for Integration">Democratic Union for Integration</a> (DUI), a political party representing the interests of the <a href="/wiki/Albanians_in_North_Macedonia" title="Albanians in North Macedonia">Albanian ethnic minority in North Macedonia</a>, expressed doubt in the legality and impartiality of the investigation, especially regarding its methodology, possible governmental interference in the prosecutor's office, and politically motivated arrests. In a later statement, DUI claimed that the investigation was "a <a href="/wiki/Sui_generis" title="Sui generis"><i>sui generis</i></a> example of legal improvisation, driven not by law, but by a desire for applause" and said that the legal system was being "abuse[d]". In particular, they criticized the withdrawal of a public prosecutor from the investigation and the release most of the suspects from prison, except for Kreshnik Bekteshi, whom they called a longtime victim of "political retaliation".
</p><p>Bogdanka Kuzeska, spokesperson for the <a href="/wiki/Social_Democratic_Union_of_Macedonia" title="Social Democratic Union of Macedonia">Social Democratic Union of Macedonia</a> (SDSM), accused Toškovski of conducting the investigation "selectively" by only arresting former <a href="/wiki/VMRO-DPMNE" title="VMRO-DPMNE">VMRO-DPMNE</a> officials, none of whom were in office after 2022. She said that Toškovski was attempting to "protect current high-ranking officials, public servants, and chiefs" who failed to prevent the fire; in particular, the head of the Internal Affairs Directorate in Kočani, Marija Cvetkovska Manevska, and the Kočani police chief, Tomo Donev, neither of whom were arrested. А SDSM MP, Slavjanka Petrovska, accused Toškovski of using his legal skills (he is an experienced lawyer) to "contaminat[e] and obstruct" the investigation to conceal possible Ministry of Internal Affairs involvement in the failure to prevent the fire, and said that Toškovski was not acting in the best interest of the people, but in the best interest of his party, VMRO-DPMNE.
</p><p>Lawyer and ex-judge Vladimir Tufegdžić criticized the government for an alleged lack of transparency to the public regarding the investigation and said that protests in Kočani may "easily escalate and become out of control". He urged the government ensure that the public understands that it is "unrealistic" for all 68 suspects to be convicted of crimes in a speedy manner, since they have the right to defend themselves in court and they likely will with all methods legally permitted to them. He also called upon the government to "mobilize" organizations that support victims of disasters.
</p><p>Toškovski accused the opposition of trying to shift blame away from themselves and trying to distract from what he claims is the real issue, that institutions "remained silent – even though they knew". He said that trust in the police is growing due to his efforts in tackling corruption in government. He denies any Ministry of Internal Affairs failures regarding the fire.

On 18 March, a crowd approached Papazov's house and attempted to breach the police barrier so that they could pelt the house with stones, but a priest pacified them, saying "Let's save the children first, then we'll burn down the city if you want."
